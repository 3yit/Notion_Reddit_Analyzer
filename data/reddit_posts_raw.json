    "selftext": "Hello people of Reddit, \n\nI wanted to share my routine that honestly completely changed my life, from being an unfocused, permanently tired, undisciplined, overweight mess to someone who’s finally productive, stable, and actually proud of herself.\n\nI even got promoted twice this year. Some of the things I changed sound kind of weird, but they worked for me.\n\n\n\nA bit about me\n\nI’m 26, F, working in IT as a product manager.\nThe last few years were rough - always exhausted, zero motivation, my relationship fell apart because I was basically just existing.\n\nAfter the breakup, I spiraled: gained weight, got depressed, and my performance at work tanked.\nMy 2024 review was the worst I’d ever had, and I was this close to being put on a PIP.\n\nSo on Jan 1st, I told myself: this is it. \n\nWhy I’m writing this\n\nI used to read this sub all the time, hoping to find something that would click.\nI tried everything - journaling, Notion setups, time blocking, 75 Hard, bullet journaling, whatever.\n\nSome of it helped a bit, most didn’t.\n\nThis year, things finally did click.\nI’m writing this because I wish I’d seen a post like this last year - something that actually worked in real life.\n\nFinal caveat: this is what worked for me after months of experimenting. But that’s it A it works for ME. I’m not advocating for everyone following the same thing to do T. Use common sense, adjust to your situation. Your mileage may vary.\n\n\nMy routine\n\nWake up: 5:00 AM sharp.\nFirst week was torture, second week my body started doing it automatically. I don’t even need an alarm now. Read up about circadian rhythm. \n\n5:05: 15 minutes of affirmations + meditation.\nI do it barefoot, standing in front of the mirror. I know it sounds strange, but saying things like “I am calm, I am focused.” actually sets my brain for the day. This is a game changer. Try out for a week and see. For meditations I go with guided meditation apps. Tried numerous, all are good. \n\n5:20: Hygiene.\nKorean skincare combo (vitamin C, snail mucin, SPF 50). My skin started glowing and people at work noticed.\n\n5:40: 0.3 L of lemon water, room temperature.\nDon’t ask me about the science, but it wakes up my body better than coffee.\n\n6:00: Gym: 4x a week, 1–1.5 hours.\nStrength training + 10 min treadmill walk.\nNo headphones.  Part of my dopamine detox.\n\n7:30: Shower, then a 15-minute foot massage with peppermint oil. Yes, seriously. It helps circulation, and triggers the lymphatic system. . \n\n7:50: Breakfast alone, 2 boiled eggs, 1 avocado, chia seeds soaked in lemon water.\nI eat outside or in silence, never at the office. It’s my “quiet time.”\nI usually read 5–10 pages of a book while eating (never fiction).\n\n8:30: At work.\nI put my phone in Focus mode and throw it in my bag. No notifications till 5PM.\nThis one habit alone probably doubled my output.\n\n\nSince I started this, I feel sharper, calmer, more balanced. My boss literally said, “You seem like a completely different person.”\n\nSome of the other microadjustments I made\n\n\t•\tNo social media. Period. Haven’t opened Instagram since February. Don’t miss them.\n\n\t•\tNo negative thoughts. If I catch myself thinking one, I literally snap my fingers and replace it with a positive one.\n\n\t•\tTherapy, twice a week. Every week. I treat it like gym for the brain.\n\n\t•\tCold showers every morning. I don’t overthink after, it’s like hitting reset.\n\n\t•\tNo caffeine after 10AM. My sleep improved instantly.\n\n\t•\tEvening routine: journaling, stretching, magnesium before bed.\n\n\t•\tSpeaking slower. Makes me seem calmer and more confident, apparently.\n\n\t•\tGratitude texts. Every night I text one person something I appreciate about them.\n\n\t•\tNo complaining. If I do, I owe my therapist €5.\n\n\t•\tSunlight before 8AM. Game changer.\n\n\t•\tChewing slower. Sounds dumb, but digestion improved and I stopped overeating.\n\n\nI know it’s a lot. But every one of these micro changes added up.\n\nIf there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that discipline isn’t about control - it’s about peace within. Come from a good place. Treat your body and mind like a temple and it will all come naturally.\n\nClosing thought: I know many of you are going through a personal struggle I don’t see…so I’m sending you encouragement and positive vibes to make a change. You got this. If I could - so can you. \n",

Less focus on getting essay drafts or help on exams\n\nBased on that, here are some AI tools that I've found genuinely useful and curious about what tools you guys are using\n\n**Perplexity AI:** my go-to alternative to Google when I want to learn a new topic quickly and comprehensively. I feel like it combines real-time information with LLM reasoning and summarization so good, perfect when you want both accuracy and depth.\n\n**NotebookLM:** since i highly rely on you/tube videos to self-study, this tool just blew my mind the first time I used it. It summarizes long videos and help you extract key takeaways, and saves you from hours of watching content that might not be worth your time. If you also have a lot of watch later videos like I did but want to filter out only the truly valuable ones, this is the one.\n\n**Kuse:** my new alternatives for NotebookLM (sry we had good days), at first I was also drawn by its ability to summarize You\\\\Tube videos into mind maps and reports, but it's actually way more powerful, it can handle all kinds of files and helps you build a very intuitive knowledge base.\n\n**Notion:** it's hard not to try Notion with its great UI and so many fancy templates. It's great when you want to turn messy notes or scattered info into structured, aesthetic outputs. But I personally find the learning curve a bit steep, especially if you just want something fast and simple.\n\nDrop the tools that you are using and found it could be a game changer!",

Still need to check them.\n\nBut don't you think the point of making notes is to study and organise your notes inside your head? It is the act of having to organise information in some reasoned way that gets you to remember and recall later. \n\nUsing AI outputs, however correct, turns it into an input operation into your brain rather than an organising one. That loses you some edge and the thing that helps active recall. And even if you recalled, it is exactly in that format you input. If you had organised yourself, you would have multiple ways of getting to that answer during active recall.\n\nMy point is that in this case, getting the right input isn't the whole point. It is the process of organising by yourself that is the point of studying.\n\nIt does get you your notes 10× faster though. I agree with that part. Not necessarily study.",

    "selftext": "I recently came across a post by **vbgosilva**, showing a calendar built entirely with formulas.\n\nI’ve always found the idea really cool. I’d thought about building something like that before, but never got around to it.\n\nSo I decided to take the concept and build my own version, focused on practicality and easy customization so I can reuse it.\n\nAfter a few hours of work, I ended up with the version shown in the first image of this post. I thought about commenting on his post, but didn’t want to come off as impolite. So I decided to make this a separate post, more detailed and, of course, giving full credit to the inspiration.\n\nWhat I like most about the formula is that it’s completely generic. You can change the date, style, or date logic without having to rewrite everything.\n\n**🧮 The formula**\n\n    /* first lets block - sets up base calendar variables: dates, weekdays, and day styles */\n    lets(\n      baseDate, today(),\n      weekdaysAbbrList, [\"Su\", \"Mo\", \"Tu\", \"We\", \"Th\", \"Fr\", \"Sa\"],\n      todayStyle, [\"default\", \"blue_background\"],\n      defaultDayStyle, [\"gray\", \"gray_background\"],\n      inactiveDayStyle, [\"gray\", \"default_background\"],\n      padSize, 2,\n      nextMonthDate, baseDate.dateAdd(1, \"month\"),\n      firstDayNextMonth, parseDate(nextMonthDate.formatDate(\"YYYY-MM-01\")),\n      baseDateLastDay, firstDayNextMonth.dateSubtract(1, \"day\"),\n      emptyDaysList, \" \".repeat(baseDateLastDay.date()).split(\"\"),\n      firstDayWeekday, parseDate(baseDate.formatDate(\"YYYY-MM-01\")).day(),\n      lastDayWeekday, baseDateLastDay.day(),\n      firstGap, \" \".repeat(if(firstDayWeekday == 7, 0, firstDayWeekday)).split(\"\"),\n      lastGap, \" \".repeat(if(lastDayWeekday == 7, 6, 6 - lastDayWeekday)).split(\"\"),\n      weekdaysAbbrList.map(current.padStart(padSize, \" \").style(\"c\", defaultDayStyle)).join(\" \") + \"\\n\" +\n      [\n        firstGap.map((current.padStart(padSize, \" \")).style(\"c\", inactiveDayStyle)).join(\" \"),\n        /* second lets block - maps over emptyDaysList to generate styled calendar days with separators */\n        emptyDaysList.map(lets(\n          dayNumber, index + 1,\n          date, parseDate(baseDate.formatDate(\"YYYY-MM-\" + dayNumber.format().padStart(2, \"0\"))),\n          /* ifs block - conditional styles for day states */\n          dayStyle, ifs(\n            date == today(), todayStyle,\n            date < today(), inactiveDayStyle,\n            defaultDayStyle\n          ),\n          styledDay, dayNumber.format().padStart(padSize, \" \").style(\"c\", dayStyle),\n          weekdayNumber, date.day(),\n          separator, ifs(index == 0 or weekdayNumber != 7, \"\", \"\\n\"),\n          separator + styledDay\n        )).join(\" \"),\n        lastGap.map((current.padStart(padSize, \" \")).style(\"c\", inactiveDayStyle)).join(\" \")\n      ].filter(current).join(\" \")\n    )\n\nJust copy and paste this formula, and you’ll have a beautiful calendar for the current month!\n\n**⚙️ How to customize**\n\n* `baseDate` — the date within the desired month/year for the calendar (or keep `today()` for the current month).\n* `weekdaysAbbrList` — a list of abbreviated weekdays, starting with Sunday and ending with Saturday.\n* `todayStyle`, `defaultDayStyle`, and `inactiveDayStyle` — define the color scheme for the days.\n* `padSize` — controls the spacing within the day blocks (useful if you want to abbreviate weekdays to 3 characters).\n\nIt’s complete, but beyond just a nice-looking calendar, you’re probably looking for a way to display or track something with the dates.\n\n**📅 Example with a Habit Tracker**\n\nAssuming you have two databases:\n\n1. **Habits** — containing the habits you want to track (where this formula will go).\n2. **Tracked Habits** — where you record the days a habit was completed.\n\nThe **Tracked Habits** database needs two properties:\n\n1. **Date** — to indicate the day the habit was completed.\n2. **Two-way relation with Habits** — to link the record to the corresponding habit.\n\nNow, back to the calendar formula (in the **Habits** database), add this variable to the first `lets` block, right after `baseDate`:\n\n    trackedHabitsDateList, prop(\"Tracked Habits\").filter(current.prop(\"Date\").formatDate(\"YYYY-MM\") == baseDate.formatDate(\"YYYY-MM\")).map(current.prop(\"Date\")),\n\n• This code accesses the **relational property Tracked Habits**, filters only the pages matching the same month and year as the `baseDate` variable, and creates a list of dates.\n\nThen, in the second `lets` block, right after the `date` variable, add:\n\n    isDateInTrackedList, trackedHabitsDateList.includes(date),\n\n• This checks whether the calendar `date` is in the `trackedHabitsDateList` and returns a true or false value.\n\nFinally, you can modify the `ifs` block to apply conditional styles based on the marked days:\n\n    dayStyle, ifs(\n      isDateInTrackedList and date == today(), [\"default\", \"Green_background\"],\n      isDateInTrackedList, [\"Green\", \"Green_background\"],\n      date == today(), todayStyle,\n      date < today(), inactiveDayStyle,\n      defaultDayStyle\n    ),\n\n*Note: Return the styles as a list* \\[\\]*, e.g.,* \\[\"default\", \"Green\\_background\"\\]*.*\n\nDone! You should now have a dynamic calendar based on your own records.\n\nIf you want to see a practical example of the instructions above: [Habit Tracker](https://ruuuff.notion.site/Habit-Tracker-28e47804890c80a8801eeda3ccaafbf3).\n\nIn this case, I used a Habit Tracker, but the logic can be adapted for any kind of date-based tracking. However, some prior knowledge of logic and Notion formulas may be necessary.\n\nI thought about keeping this exclusive to my templates, but it was too cool not to share.\n\nI hope you find it useful!\n\nAnd once again, thanks to **vbgosilva** for the inspiration.\n\n*Edit: I’m also a creator! If you’d like to explore templates made with the same care as this post and formula, you can find them here:* [ruff | Notion Marketplace](https://www.notion.com/@ruuuff)*. Thanks!!*",

        "body": "Yeah I think most people experience this from time to time. The trouble is \"task switching cost\" - jumping between Slack, Notion, email, work, etc, your prefrontal cortex had to completely reload context each time which just burns through your mental bandwidth and makes you \"feel busy\".\n\nWhen you shift tasks, part of your brain is still thinking about the previous task (appropriately called \"attention residue\") so you're never actually giving full resources to anything. It feels like productivity because you're moving constantly, but you're running at reduced capacity all day. It's sort of like having a bunch of tabs open in your browser.\n\nThe funny thing is that the fix for this is something called \"singular focus protocol\", basically your \"DO ONE REAL THING\" sticky note so you kind of did solve the problem already.\n\nBy forcing your brain to commit to ONE task, you eliminated the switching cost. Your prefrontal cortex could actually finish building the mental model it needed to solve the problem.\n\nAs a fun aside (because I love stuff like this), it takes like 23 minutes to reach full cognitive engagement on a complex task but most people never get there because they break focus every 11 minutes for things like Slack, email, or \"just checking\" something.\n\nAlso, just for the sake of completeness, you're right that our brain releases dopamine when it perceives progress toward a goal. Slack replies don't usually trigger it because they're reactive, not goal-directed. But shipping that landing page is measurable forward movement so your reward circuitry lit up.\n\nI don't think the answer is \"less structure works better\" because it's not actually less structure. It's SIMPLER structure, which I think is an important point to make. One clear target beats ten organized tasks every time.\n\nRemember, your brain can't optimize for ten things simultaneously but it's incredibly good at optimizing for one.\n\nJust as a shameless plug, if you dig stuff like this (identifying and leveraging psychological concepts to improve your life) I publish a 3 minute newsletter 3x per week called the Daily Mindset Flip (link is in my bio under my social links), I love talking about stuff like this.\n\nEdit: Reddit had some weird content duplication things happening when the comment posted so I cleaned it up.",

Frankly, the solution is to simplify processes rather than adopting a new tool. Set a single rule: Whether it's a spreadsheet, credit card, or account, every financial transaction must go through a single channel and document. Second, dedicate half a day each week to these activities (for example, Friday morning), and avoid dealing with financial matters during the week until the due date. Like any other administrative task, this takes the rest of the week off the table and brings it back into a structured process. Bringing the chaos back into a clear routine allows you to regain your focus.",

Finances, property stuff, pet records, insurance docs, tech infrastructure notes. I think I'm subconciously heading towards a second brain / Life RAG kind of setup that'll work well with AI tools going forward.\n\nI've been going hard on the database first approach instead of just making a bunch of random pages. Once you start using relations and rollups and filtered views, its honestly kind of addictive seeing everything connect together.\n\nI'm also using Notion AI a fair bit (its pretty good), but I've caught it deleting or overwriting stuff a few times without asking, which is... fun. So yeah, keeping an eye on that.\n\nAnyway, for people who've been using Notion for a while, what do you wish you'd done differently from the start? What should I be thinking about now before this thing gets too big and complex?\n\nAny wisdom appreciated",

One key thing I've used it for is mass updates or data cleanup in a database. One of my workspaces is a content calendar I use for planning a Substack newsletter that I'm writing. And I needed to update the schedule dates for almost 50 different posts that I had (essentially, I wanted to insert a new post earlier in the content calendar than later).\n\nPrior to the agent: I would have had to go in, manually update and increment each post date by 1 day. It would have taken me 20 minutes or so to do all of the clicking. And I probably would have just given up and said I won't do it.\n\nWith their AI: I just used the following command > \"I want to insert this new post on x date. Can you take every post that I have queued up starting on y date, and increment them by 1 day, so that there is an open day for posts on x date?\" 15 seconds later it was done. \n\nIt was my first real \"ah-ha\" moment with how to leverage the AI. There have been some hiccups (I was asking it to try and do the relationship management between to different workspaces and databases, and essentially figure out the optimal setup for what I was trying to achieve after describing my workflow) and it simply said it wasn't able to help. So I think there is still room for improvement.\n\nBut I think the guidance for anyone out there: If you find yourself about to do a lot of \"repetitive clicking\" or \"repetitive typing\", go to the AI agent first.",

I’ve completely revoked **microphone and screen recording permissions** at the system level, and the app still somehow *knows* when a meeting starts.

That’s not just a minor UX trick: it’s a form of **process monitoring**. Even if it’s not recording audio, it’s still behavior most people would *never expect* from a note-taking app.\n\nHas anyone found a way to completely stop this detection?

However, with my recent move from Clickup to Notion, and the fact I am running multiple company projects & tasks within it, I decided to dig into Notion's [Content & Use Policy.](https://www.notion.so/notion/Content-Use-Policy-1b9a773d5583486cb5c1d39a8d777a55) \n\nSome things that concern me and are a bit ambiguous *(I'm not an attorney)* are the following:\n\n**1. You may not use Notion to post, upload, share, or store malicious software, malware, viruses, or other harmful code.**\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\n* The wording around “malicious software” and “other harmful code” feels too broad.\n* JSON files are just plain text, but some systems might treat them as “code” if they include logic, API references, or scripts.\n* I want to confirm that storing AI agent setups, configs, or templates as simple JSON files is fine under this policy.\n* On the flip side, I understand that encoded automation scripts or runnable code could cross the line. I just want clarity that plain text configs like .doc or .txt are safe and compliant. \n\n**2. You may not use Notion to post or share content that is illegal or infringes on the rights of others (including intellectual-property rights)**\n\n**Why this matters:**\n\n* We sometimes store videos or images made in tools like Sora, Veo, or Runway that include brand logos or celebrity likenesses, but only with written client approval. Does that still fall under “posting or sharing content that infringes on the rights of others”?\n* If an automation pulls that approved content from Notion and posts it to a client’s site or social media, how does Notion decide if that’s a violation?\n* Is enforcement based on automated flags, third-party reports, or verified proof of rights?\n* Also, does simply storing approved visuals of medical products or other brand assets inside Notion count as “posting or sharing”?\n* We use Adobe, Canva, Veo, etc for design and creation. Notion is just for reference, task tracking, and delivery. \n* Some of our automations publish those approved assets externally with full client permission, and I’d like to confirm if that counts as “posting or sharing” under Notion’s policy.\n\n\n\nAre there any Notion Folks on here that could help out with this? I want to make sure we stay in compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "As a liberal arts student, I've tons of files and sources that have track and store for, and tried a lot of note-taking tools or knowledge management system. In my freshman year, I relied entirely on pen and paper, by sophomore year, I fell in love with OneNote. In junior year, Notion became my main tool. By senior year, I gradually phased out both OneNote and Notion, switching to a combination of Zotero (for research) and Kuse (for all other coursework and career prep).\n\nI've truly experienced how different (or seems fancy) these tools, and honestly they all have pros and const, it's just important to pick the one or system that fits your own demand or main goal. So hope some of my takeaways can help you choose what works best for you.\n\nOneNote: what I love most about OneNote is its layout flexibility, it's easy to organize and visually extend your pages. The UI fits my aesthetic perfectly, and it feels almost like a digital bullet journal, I can layer notes infinitely and rearrange them in a very intuitive way which I really like.\nIts biggest downside for me is weak synchronization. Since I often record the information in a lot of different formats and across devices, syncing and integrating notes became inconvenient over time.\n\nNotion: it offers the widest variety of templates for sure, from notes to dashboards, calendars, and entire workspaces. Also I like that it supports Markdown, and its overall clean design is something I really appreciate.\nBut after long-term use, I found myself valuing form over function. It started feeling a bit too fancy for simple note-taking. For quick daily captures or lightweight learning notes, the structures sometimes felt unnecessarily complex for me, and it did affect some of my positivity\n\nKuse: one thing I like most is that it supports all file types, PDFs, videos, images, links, into one visual workspace.\nIt gives me the freedom and spatial flexibility I once loved in OneNote, but with stronger capabilities for deep learning, resource integration, and creative output. I also love that it can easily generate portfolios or websites directly from your workspace. The downside so far is that there aren't many advanced templates or mature use cases available yet. Customizing the visual style or building a personal workflow aesthetic still takes a lot of effort.\n\nObsidian: a classic Markdown-based editor, love the customization and flexibility. Also the plugin ecosystem is incredibly rich, and I especially love the built-in mind map support. But that's also part of the challenge: with so many plugins, community scripts, and tutorials, the learning curve can be steep. It's powerful but it also takes serious time and experimentation to build a personal system that feels cohesive and efficient like other fancy tutorials look like.",

If I am in a hurry, I will put a quick note in my Inbox as a reminder to put it in my Master Schedule later. I have the Notion App on my phone which makes input easy.\n\nA great example of how my system serves me happened last night. I was working on my MacBook and saw a timer at the top letting me know my lab draw was in 11 hours. I had not remembered the lab draw until I saw that reminder.

Once I pass 10+ projects, I forget where I’ve tucked certain pages or which database I linked something to.\n\nI started experimenting with a few tools to help with recall instead of just structure. Notion is still my main hub, but I’ve been pairing it with eesel AI, which automatically surfaces the pages and docs for me that I’ve opened recently across Notion, Google Docs, and even Figma. \n\nIt doesn’t change how I build databases or dashboards, but it helps me find what I built faster. Curious if anyone else here combines Notion with external tools to handle recall and context switching. Do you rely purely on naming conventions and backlinks, or use automation to help?\n\n",

Use automations to add them, and AI to process, search, etc.\n\nJust my two cents. It helped me a lot. Maybe it could help you.",

        "body": "I totally get what you mean, Notion starts out feeling super organized, but once there are too many pages and databases, it turns into a maze instead of a system.\n\nFrom my experience, this usually happens because we try to build too many setups without being 100% clear on our main priorities. Organizing feels productive, so we keep creating more pages, but most of them aren’t even necessary.\n\nWhat really helps is keeping the structure lean and purpose-driven \n\n**1- First get clear on your major focus areas :** If those aren’t clear, everything feels scattered, no matter how many dashboards you build.\n\n**2- Build only a few core databases :** Areas, Goals, Projects, Tasks, Notes etc. Everything else (like content calendars, resources, etc.) should be linked inside the related project or goal, not as separate independent databases. So whenever you open a project, you automatically see all the notes, content ideas, links, etc. connected to it, no searching.\n\n**3- Keep it simple to avoid overwhelm :** A minimal but clear structure makes things easier to find, even if you don’t remember where you stored them, the system guides you there.\n\nPersonally, I don’t use any extra tool for recall. I just keep my homepage clean with only frequent-use links + today’s tasks. And inside each task, I attach all required links/resources, so when I sit down to work, there’s zero friction or searching.\n\nHope this perspective helps, sometimes reducing is more powerful than adding more tools 😊",

The main issue is not the tool, but the behavior.\n\nYou can have the best Notion system, but if the users do not change their behavior, they will fail on the first step of the funnel process. \n\nSo, first, try to understand why people should manage tasks in Notion at all. Probably they already have other places where they track what to do, forcing them to switch will always create friction. If your goal is to make Notion your to go tool, you need to make it feel like the easiest and most natural place to add or check tasks.\n\nWhat I think will already help you is, dividing this into two chunks: Capture and Execution. Usually, I wouldn’t jump directly into solutions because they can be biased and lack a more extensive context. But I'm trying to spark some ideas, so let’s go.\n\nFor the Capture, your goal is to make it as easy as possible. Ie: adding a Slack shortcut, an Apple shortcut where they press a combination of keys and it would trigger a field to input the task name, or using Raycast or something like that. One interesting thing to keep in mind is: Every columns you add to your Notion database that need to be filled in, the less likely they are to be completed. So try to automate the hell out of it and reduce the number of bureaucracy. Remember that you’re trying your best to change a behavior, so it’s important to build momentum and cadence.\n\nThis will kickoff the loop.\n\nFor the execution: how to change the behavior for them to check the tasks more constantly, reducing the barriers to have access to them to perform a task. Reducing the barriers to entry (capture), is a big step, improving the database, another one, but we need to look at the likelihood of them thinking about or seeing that notion page, ie: suggest to them to have it pinned on their browser; or create a keyboard shortcut that opens the database on their dashboard or something like that.\n\nPs: I recommend a read on the B.J. Fogg model, where they talk about the motivation, ability, and promptness\n\nThere are several techniques that could help with the change of behavior, and plenty of other options that you could improve your Notion system. To keep it Reddit friendly I will stop here haha\n\nHope this brings you some light!",

I love its clean, beautiful interface—but in recent years it’s become hard to use day-to-day.\n\nWhat’s not working:\n\n## Search is unreliable.\n\n•\t⁠When I search for a word that’s definitely in a note, I get a flood of irrelevant results. I’ve tried every fix I could find online; the problem persists. A notes app with broken search isn’t a notes app.\n\n## Formatting with Korean input is buggy.\n\n•\t⁠After I change a line to a heading or make it bold, the next line inherits the previous style when I type in Korean, so I have to select the text and re-format it. Very annoying.\n\n## No Markdown support.\n\n•\t⁠I have to manually change styles instead of just typing # for headings, - for lists, etc.\n\nBecause of these issues—especially the first two, which didn’t seem to be problems years ago—Apple Notes has become impractical for me.\n\nWhat I still like:\n\n•\t⁠The UI is simple and beautiful. •\t⁠The orange checkmark is easy to spot; I use it to mark items I want to notice (I don’t want checked items grayed out).\n\nApps I’ve tried (and why they didn’t stick)\n\n## Obsidian\n\nGreat on desktop, but on iPhone it’s not for me. Plugins feel heavy; needing a plugin just to create a new note in a folder is too much.\n\n## Notion\n\nThe interface is dizzying and distracting; it’s hard to scan at a glance.\n\n## Simplenote\n\nI love the simplicity, but no folders. If it had folders, I’d probably use it.\n\n## UpNote\n\nNot bad, but not quite there. Checked items turn grayed out (maybe I could get used to it?), and the note preview height in folders is a bit large—so it’s a bit hard to scan at a glance.\n\n## Joplin\n\nSolid, but on mobile it takes multiple taps to get into edit mode, which is inconvenient.\n\n## Bear, Drafts, Notebook, Google Keep\n\nThe folder/structure isn’t easy to scan at a glance; the overall style isn’t mine.\n\n## Evernote\n\nMy account was compromised in a past breach; I won’t return.\n\nFor style, Apple Notes, Simplenote, and Joplin feel the most straightforward to me.\n\n**Is there any decent app that’s simple, well-functioning, supports reliable search, plays nicely with Korean input, and ideally offers Markdown—especially on iPhone? That’s really all I need.**",

Embrace Minimalism**\n\n* Keep only essential metrics on your dashboard; everything else can live behind quick-access buttons.\n* Minimize relational databases—use them only when truly needed.\n* Complex setups quickly become burdens; simplicity is key.\n\n**2. Focus on Core Functions**\n\n* Many users rely on just one or two databases (e.g., *Tasks* \\+ *Journal*).\n* A simple to-do list and daily log often do the job.\n\n**3. Be Careful with Habit Trackers & Automation**\n\n* Habit trackers and over-logging can add stress instead of reducing it.\n* Only add automation or templates if they genuinely help.\n* Small habits are often better managed offline than digitally tracked.\n\n**4. Leverage Quality Templates**\n\n* *Thomas Frank’s Ultimate Brain* came up often—lightweight, modular, PARA-based.\n* Add-ons like *Flylighter* help with web clipping and note capture.\n\n**5. Customize to Your Needs**\n\n* Start with free templates → observe what you actually use → customize gradually.\n* Automate only repetitive tasks to save time.\n* Keep refining what feels clunky until it fits naturally.\n\n**6. Mix Analog & Digital**\n\n* Use physical notes or post-its for quick daily tasks.\n* Let Notion handle structure and long-term organization.\n* Some even use Notion as a lightweight website builder.\n\n**7. Great for Collaboration**\n\n* Perfect for shared projects, household tracking, or even family wine ratings!\n\n**8. Moderate Complexity Works Too**\n\n* A single dashboard with three DBs (Projects, Goals, Tasks) can be ideal.\n* Notes and documents nested within projects keep things tidy.\n\n**9. Student & Academic Use Cases**\n\n* Combine schedules, assignments, and resources in one place.\n* Use multiple views (Kanban, Calendar) for flexibility.\n* Link classes, modules, and deadlines for quick navigation.\n\n\n\n**Common Takeaway**\n\n* Find the sweet spot between *simplicity* and *structure.*\n* Keep only what reduces stress and truly supports your daily flow.\n* Notion works best as a tool you gradually shape to fit *you*—not something you have to adapt yourself to.\n* Many also recommended pairing Notion with analog tools like notebooks and post-its for a hybrid approach.\n\nThanks again for all your wisdom! This community is amazing!!",

Now I want to bring a bit more structure back into my life.\n\nWhat I’m looking for:\n\n* A program or app that helps me **set, track and visualize long-term goals**, specifically on three levels:\n   1. Multiple years \n   2. Yearly goals\n   3. Monthly goals\n* After that (weekly/daily) I’ll keep using paper + notebook, so I don’t need those levels in the app.\n* The app should also allow me to **collect, store and structure notes** on different themes for example: favourite cooking recipes, helpful posts from forums or Reddit, ideas, etc.\n* Ideally it works on both **desktop and mobile**, but priority is desktop\n\nA few years ago I used Notion for this, but I didn’t find it very intuitive and eventually stopped using it after the birth of our children. Now I would have to completely re-familiarize myself with it. So I wonder: Have there been better apps/programs since then for these two purposes (long-term goal tracking and note/idea collection)?\n\nAny recommendations, experiences or suggestions are much appreciated.\n\n Thanks in advance!",

Between midterms, project deadlines, and helping out with the Halloween event on campus, I was running on caffeine and vibes lol. But a few AI tools honestly saved me. They helped me stay organized, study faster, and still have fun.\n\n\n\n**Proactor** ([proactor.ai](https://proactor.ai)) was a total lifesaver. It joined every group call I had, took clean notes, and listed action items automatically. When everyone was talking over each other about costumes and booth setup, it somehow kept everything straight. Then it synced the notes to Notion so I didn’t have to rewrite anything.\n\n\n\n**Wisper Flow** ([wisperflow.ai](https://wisperflow.ai)) helped me record and summarize my study sessions. I’d talk through my notes out loud, and it turned everything into organized summaries I could review later. It’s so good for active recall if you like speaking your thoughts.\n\n\n\n**AskSurf** ([asksurf.ai](https://asksurf.ai)) was my go to for quick research. I used it to find credible sources for an ethics essay and even to get creative ideas for Halloween costumes. It’s like chatting with a super smart search engine that actually gives you answers instead of links.\n\n\n\n**Makeform** ([makeform.ai](https://makeform.ai)) handled all my event sign ups. I made a quick volunteer form, shared it in our group chat, and instantly got names and contacts all in one sheet. No more random messages or messy spreadsheets.\n\n\n\n**Chatslide** ([chatslide.ai](https://chatslide.ai)) saved my grade tbh. I had a short class presentation due the same week, and it built the slides straight from my notes. They looked clean and professional. Took me less than 10 minutes to finish what usually takes hours.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the week, I actually made it to the Halloween party without feeling totally dead. If you’re trying to balance studying and events, these tools really make a difference.",

    "selftext": "Hey, community!\nIf your setup is \"lagging,\" I'm willing to bet you have 5 linked views on your main dashboard, and every single one of them is showing all 50+ properties from your database. Of course it's going to lag.\nSimple test: Go into Properties on those views and hide everything except the 3-5 properties you actually need to see there. You will feel the difference immediately.\nIn my personal system, I have 5-7 deep databases, each with ~100 properties (finances, CRM, content). Nothing lags. Because my dashboards are optimized.\nBut this leads to a much more interesting thought.\nIt's kind of funny that most people are using this incredible tool (where you can build literally any app from scratch) as a simple notebook. And they still manage to use it in a way that makes it lag.\nThis proves we're not in a notebook. We're in a development environment.\nBut this doesn't mean everyone needs to become a \"developer.\" It means Notion is repeating the path of Google and Facebook.\nThink about it: It is much easier to launch an ad on Facebook Ads than it is to build a working CRM or financial tracker in Notion.\nAnyone can \"boost a post\" in 5 minutes. But to get real results, companies hire media buyers—professionals who understand how the auction, audiences, and creatives work.\nThe exact same thing is happening with Notion.\nThe platform has become too complex for \"just users.\" And the market for \"aesthetic-only templates\" that have no real optimization is a dead end.\nThe future of Notion belongs to \"Notion Architects.\" To professionals who build custom, optimized systems that actually solve problems, not just look pretty.\nNotion can't replace Google and Microsoft on its own. It needs this internal ecosystem of pros, just like Facebook needs media buyers.\nDo you agree? Or is it still \"just a notebook\"?",

        "body": "Hey this is a very common problem! Here are some tips.\n\n1. Make databasements. A databasement is a page where you hide away your original databases. Original databases take up more space and are slower to load. If you need a database on a specific page, pull a linked view- it is much easier to load!\n2. Use less in-line databases and also reduce the amount of pages loaded. if you have a massive amount of databases on a page- its going to lag especially if there's more items there. Also the amount of information condensed on those databases could be contributing too.\n3. use toggled headers. toggled headers are able to reduce lagspikes by softly archiving the display of information away. the truth is that you dont need to see everything at one time- instead, pull up the context when you need it- and save the headache of lagspikes\n4. This is going to sound insane, but really you probably have too many databases in general. In my setup, I have theee databases for information - depending on if the information is just for internal infrastructure, the public (published),  or if the information is ONLY for my eyes (like revenue or a crm). I have a single library of 2000 documents that only use one single datasource-- and it works EXTREMELY efficiently for API calls, RAG, and vector.\n5. BE VICIOUSLY MERCILESS on deleting, archiving, and editing your workspace to be smaller, concise, and intentional. Information hoarding, suboptimal space use, and outdated workflows and tools drag everything down- if you really want to keep it, make a second workspace entierly and transfter information over there- that way you dont lose it but its also not sapping your precious performance.\n6. If you have files and pictures.... you might need to compress a lot of them. I would use webp for images since that is the smallest and most efficient image size you can get without sacrificing too much quality, and also look into... keeping portions of documents and shrinking the size.\n\nIf you need help optimizing your space, I would be happy to assist you in making something that can go lightning fast! heres my discord handle if you need help: gm\\_paladin\n\nEnjoy your day!  \n\\- Paladin",

        "body": "I used Notion for worldbuilding for ages and Scrivener for writing. A year ago, i replaced both with Obsidian and now, a year later, i have never been happier, with how my writing is going and how my vault looks. However, it took me 2-3 months to really settle into Obsidian. I am also aesthetically minded and just had to learn how to set up and use Obsidian to give me what I wanted. It was frustrating and fun at the same time. So for people who want to tweak, i can't say Obsidian feels immediately intuitive. However, i will say this:\n- When i migrated things from Notion (manually), i realized I had barely done any writing in it, although I had tons and tons of notes. (I'm referring to the content of my worldbuilding and story notes here). Notion had forced me into categorizing and defining things so that everything was sorted, which had helped at the time, and i had enjoyed it, but that is not the purpose of the project. A lot of my notes had elaborate properties setup to show in different views, but the body of the note was almost empty. This is in part i think because what's inside the body of a note feels completely hidden and unsearchable in Notion. Obsidian immediately stimulated me to actually fill out notes and build meaning and connections - as an app, it just stimulates you to write - that's just what you do in Obsidian. \n- From this perspective, i would feel anxious about keeping things in Notion because you have very limited options when it comes to backing up your work, and we know how important that is for writing projects. What if you lose everything? Obsidian has amazing backup and version control options with git and other plugins, so it feels much safer to host my whole writing project here.\n- It's very easy to search and discover things in obsidian, connect chapters with any kind of note about them, work with all the relevant notes you need for a specific part of your writing simultaneously. This just facilitates great writing sessions for me. With Notion, it's very easy to just bury info where you may never find it or look at it again - search is practically none existent. I came to hate this.\n\nOverall, i adore my obsidian. I always recommend it to writers IF they understand it'll take a while for things to settle in. If this is fine with you, give it a go. But for people who like to tinker, there's usually a period at the start in which they work ON obsidian and not IN obsidian. For me, once I got to a point where i was reasonably happy with how everything looked and worked, i started working IN obsidian and i feel like it gave me soo much creative freedom. But i ocassionally still get the tinkering bug. That being said, i also spent ages prettyfying my Notion, so the time sink between the tools is comparable I think.",

Problem with Obsidian: The basic functions are barebones (on purpose), formatting is limited and you'll often see special characters (## headings, ** bold, etc) show up in the line you're writing on, which can be jarring. It's tempting to spend time messing with Obsidian to make it nice instead of actually writing (\"working *on* obsidian instead of *in* obsidian\").\n\nTLDR: If Notion closes down or decides they don't like you, it's all gone. Obsidian might be distracting until your setup is \"perfect\" but your writing is future proof.\n\n(might be biased, but I've been burned by disappearing documents in Notion)",

I see all these amazing templates and dashboards people build.\nMy problem is, I'll sit down to do an actual task, but first, I'll open Notion to get \"organized.\"\n...Two hours later, I've done zero of my actual work, but I've completely redesigned my \"Life Hub,\" added a new icon set, and spent 45 minutes trying to figure out a database relation.\nIt feels like these \"blank canvas\" apps are a giant hyperfocus trap. They're like a box of digital LEGOs for my brain. I spend more time building the system than using the system.\nWorse, \"out of sight, out of mind\" is a huge issue for me. If a task is hidden inside a database, it basically doesn't exist.\nHas anyone else experienced this? How do you deal with it? Have you found a way to use these tools without the endless, unproductive tinkering? Or have you just given up on them?",

This can be down in Claude's website under settings -> connectors.\n\nA really cool use case for this is where Notion plays the role as an MCP Server, Claude acts as the MCP client that is provided offline memory for future chat sessions you. This comes in handy with a Claude code session in a given code repo.\n\nin real world usage the example is.. \n\n1. As mentioned setup Notion as a connector in Claude\n\n2. It's standard practice for Claude code to create a file called [claude.md](http://claude.md) in your project repo. It uses this to understand the context of the project.\n\n3. Add a reference in that file to the notion article to tell Claude to always look at the article at the start of a session. \n\nThe goal here is to give Claude code more context about the project your working on (history, goals, outstanding tasks, lessons learned, etc..). Even better if you ask Claude code to help you add this file. If your Claude is \"connected\" it can create the content for you. \n\nWhat advantage is this?\n\nClaude doesn't have great memory from chat to chat about the work it does with you. This is an opportunity to drive more knowledge into your code sessions with Claude code hopefully improving quality of what you produce. Without this, you're re-explaining your architecture, decisions, and progress every session. \n\nJust thought it was a cool new way to get value out of notion.",

    "selftext": "I built this template because I wanted a one-page overview of my whole trip.\n\nWhen I looked at how most people planned their international trips on Notion, there were a couple issues I kept hitting:\n\n1. **Loading Time Issues.** Templates slowed down over time because the assumption was all the travels should be in one dashboard.\n2. **Confusing Layouts & Lack of Documentation.** The layout gets confusing because I'm approaching the planning process very different for every new destination and there's just no repeatable workflow that's documented.\n3. **Updates During Notion.** Whenever there's a new Notion update, I would have to adjust the whole system altogether which affects all of my data across my trips.\n\nSo I, essentially, decided to take things into my own hands and build a template that really works for the way I travel. Some insights on my travels:\n\n1. **I always travel with other people.** They're often busy people who have day jobs or commitments, hence my travels are limited to under two weeks and I try to plan every hour while making room for rest and relaxation.\n2. **I'm type A before the trip so that I can just be type B during the trip.** I don't like overthinking things or running out of things to do when I'm another country and suddenly, we have free time.\n3. **I need everything in one page.** My guiding principle is simple: anything complex should be summarized on one page. That’s how I simplify my travel plans. I've planned four group trips in 2025 and this is one of the ways I've managed to stay sane lol\n\nThis is the base template I've used to plan my travels with Notion since 2023, but I have updated this (and will keep updating it) over the years based on new features and new ways I've managed my travels.\n\n[Here's the link to the template.](https://www.notion.com/templates/one-page-travel-planner)",

They are going to be kept as ideas for the next released version, otherwise I will be forever building and never releasing.\n\nBiggest challenge for me was that I am deep down a perfectionist and I wanted to make it the best I could and not stop at a minimum viable product level. As my skills improved I wanted to build more of what I think is needed and useful. Notion also kept enhancing its capabilities so I wanted to implement those too. I wanted it to be a product I really use happily myself which could also be a great product for many others.

So I had to change them to something different\n\n4-) Recently custom emojis got randomly deleted from my workspace and I had to replace them all from main pages to database templates and so on.\n\n5-) They recently changed how sub tasks work (are displayed) so I had to change how they are set up in few dozens of different views in my entire setup \n\nI could list more, but I won't exhaust you :)",

And each area of tasks has it’s own unique properties: music production for example: stage property (production/mixing/mastering), but as I have all my tasks on a single database, these music production unique properties are shown in other tasks too, college tasks for example, I don’t want to see this property in them but I have to because they’re all on a single database.\nNow you might ask, why not separating these different task-types to different databases? Here’s the issue, because in my main dashboard I have a linked-view of my tasks database to show me the due today tasks, therefore they should be all in the same database, I don’t want to have multiple areas in my main dashboard each one has its own due today set of tasks, and unfortunately at the mean time, Notion doesn’t allow you to gather multiple databases in a single view, and the new data sources thing didn’t help so it was disappointing.",

Long term you should want to open up the system and use it, because its making your life easier. If this isn't the case the problem is again with the system.\n* What is it about Jira that makes it less of a barrier to update? Is it lower friction, the updates are easier to write, something else? Reflect on what you feel when opening Jira that you don't when opening your 2nd Brain. \n\nI personally can't use Notion in isolation, quick capture has to be done elsewhere (Google Keep, email, notebook for me personally). A weekly review to get everything up to date keeps the system clear and current. Perhaps give up on daily updating and move to weekly as a starter?",

I also have it update its own instructions based on my feedback, so over time it has learned my rhythms.\n\t•\tEvening: I close the loop. I mark things complete, process the voice notes I captured during the day, reschedule what slipped, and check on bigger projects and family areas.\n\nHow I interact with it: I reply by dictation to the AI’s summary and status report. Those replies handle the updates for me:\n\t•\tmark items complete\n\t•\trelate something to a new or existing note and add context\n\t•\treschedule to a specific date or time\n\t•\tlog what was completed so related SOPs or playbooks stay current\n\nWeekly report: Since I use this for personal and business, my instructions also generate a Friday report: what I accomplished (with short explanations), anything blocked that needs client input, and a preview of next week’s priorities.\n\nThat is it.

Things started to get hectic and tasks were slipping, updates missing, so I built a chatbot in Discord, wired it through n8n to our entire Notion task list.\n\nInitially, it was just task management. Each morning the bot messaged every department channel with that team’s tasks for the day and asks for updates on previous work. If a new task is needed I would just send a vm or text and our notion would automatically be updated.\n\nThen I added a RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) layer so the bot has our docs sorted and searchable in-chat for brainstorming and retrieving relevant info. Finally I made it learn from us: added functionality to join & transcribe our team calls, and every night at midnight it summarises all calls and chats across the entire server into its knowledge base, so it gets smarter about the team, tasks, ideas and how to respond.\n\nNow our agent is optimized and is a literal second brain for us: it keeps track of everyone in their channels automatically, summarises meetings and discussions, connects directly to Notion to retrieve important information instantly and has become a key tool in managing our workflow. I’ve added ability to schedule it’s own texts so it isn’t just reactive, it reaches out to us first. \n\nThis really helped me out and now I’m curious; what other workflows or teams do you think something like this could benefit? What other features do you think would really help individual or team productivity? \n\nI understand Notion has just rolled out its own AI but I haven’t felt it be as helpful as this so far.",

Option: You already have AI search across all notes, but it doesn't navigate to the location of the found text within the note itself. You could make it jump directly to the note, and then allow you to navigate to the found matches within the note.\n\n \n\n2. Or, the AI ​​search works as before: go to the note it found, and inside the note, open the \"...\" menu, and there will be an item called **\"Search within note.\"** After entering the text and searching, it goes to the location of the first found occurrence of the text, next to which there are arrows for moving between adjacent found variants, and a counter of the found variants.\n\n  \nEven if the Notion team doesn't see this post, I suggest anyone who cares about this feature write to Notion support at [team@makenotion.com](mailto:team@makenotion.com) with a request to add a feature to search for text within a note and navigate between found variants.  \nI have already written feedback for their developers.\n\nIf we write to support en masse, I think we'll get a \"Search within note\" feature for notes in Notion mobile apps in the near future.",

They bought a receipt printer, did some coding, setup a corkboard to pin printed tasks to aka kanban board.  When a task gets done, they crumble the receipt and toss it into a glass jar - which is like their video game score.\n\nngl, I felt like face-palming cause I'd just write down the todos on scrap paper, and I wouldn't be writing down every task.  Corkboard + pushpins is also not as convenient as whiteboard + magnetic bulldog clips.\n\nHowever, I will be \"stealing\" the glass jar idea.  For one thing, it reminded me of the redditor who used \"paperclips\" in glass jars as task tally.  Also the redditor whose kid does similar with ?nut? shells.  There's also a LOT of people who use stickers as rewards.\n\nI've low expectation that tossing done tasks into a glass jar will improve my workflow, but it's such an easy thing to setup, so I'm just gonna try it.",

    "selftext": "For years, I was in a committed, long-term relationship with my productivity system. You know the one: a sprawling \"second brain\" in Notion, connected to a calendar, synced with a to-do app, all governed by a complex set of rules and templates.\n\nI spent my Sunday evenings with it. I tweaked it, optimized it, and curated it. But I realized our relationship was toxic. I was spending more time maintaining the system than it was giving back to me. The system itself had become the primary task.\n\nSo I ended it. I logged out of everything. It felt like a messy breakup.\n\nFor a week, I was adrift. Then I realized the truth: I didn't need a single, all-encompassing system. What I needed was the right tool at the right moment. I needed \"friends with benefits\", simple, single-purpose tools I could call on when needed and ignore when I didn't.\n\nMy new philosophy is a \"productivity toolbox,\" not a monolithic system. It looks like this:\n\n* **When I'm completely overwhelmed with tasks:** I don't open a massive project board.  I analyse my problem, pull out an Eisenhower matrix, It takes 5 minutes, clarifies exactly what to work on next, and calms the anxiety.\n* **When I need to plan something with a colleague:** We don't need a new Asana project. We just need a dead-simple shared priority list to rank items 1, 2, 3 together.\n* **When I just need to get tasks out of my head:** I don't need tags, projects, or due dates. I just need a basic, clean to do list that I can add to and check off, do Ivy lee for a week.\n\nThis approach has been a game-changer. There's no maintenance, No complex workflows. No guilt for not filling out every field in a database. I just identify the feeling (\"I'm overwhelmed,\" \"I need to collaborate\") and grab the right tool for that specific job.\n\nHas anyone else abandoned a complex system for something simpler? I feel like I've just discovered the magic of using a screwdriver instead of trying to hammer in screws with a wrench.",

        "body": "TL;DR: I made a Notion template called Clarity Compass to turn strategy into daily actions. Been using it for 2 years while building it. It took me from scattered to actually finishing stuff.  \n  \nHi guys,\n\nIn the last 2 years I've been building Clarity Compass for Notion. A system which is focused on creating strategies and turning them into actions easily.\n\nI've built this in the first place for myself because I forgot so much stuff, I couldn't concentrate, and even when I had written out all my tasks, I had no motivation.  \nNow that I'm using Clarity Compass it has revamped my productivity. Now I'm able to juggle a full time job, running a business, having multiple high demanding interests, a family life and a social life.\n\nMy template is built on three principles:\n\n1. Ease of use and functionality first. There is one simple way to navigate, one way to view your goals, tasks and actions without you having to open up side peek.\n2. Built around strategy instead of projects: Clarity Compass helps you to create a strategy, and link your purposes, goals, tasks and actions. It helps you to clear your mind, structure your thoughts, and then focus on the task at hand. This way you are doing the tasks that actually matter to you.\n3. Many functionalities, integrated -> Clarity Compass has 12 separate modules, each with its own specific functionality and come together in one simple My Task Dashboard. Which also happens to be the homepage; instead of creating one which is full of useless links I've made this one to be extremely action oriented.\n\nI've also built a recurrence formula I'm proud of. With support for time of day, intervals, weekdays, ordinals, months, language localization, resetting overdue habits, a date catch-up tool and instant error feedback. And I've gone to great lengths to make Clarity Compass fast and stable. It runs smoothly with 10,000+ items in a database (because we use helper databases and properties) and it will even work when you make a task recur on February the 29th of a leap year.\n\nWant to track habits, review your tasks, track challenges like \"Running 10 miles\", track products you are building or relationships or work in sprints with your team? It's all possible in Clarity Compass and integrated throughout the template and the tasks dashboard.\n\nWe have a private [Circle.so](http://Circle.so) community where you can ask questions and we're releasing 4 YouTube videos every week on our YouTube channel [https://www.youtube.com/@DynaBeeLabs](https://www.youtube.com/@DynaBeeLabs) with Notion tutorials and productivity tips.\n\nIf you are interested:\n\n* more what-do-I-get info on: [https://www.dynabeelabs.com](https://www.dynabeelabs.com)\n* if you like to buy Clarity Compass: [https://www.dynabeelabs.com](https://www.dynabeelabs.com) or Notion marketplace: [https://www.notion.so/profile/templates/form/published/fe8aa42f-9c9f-45a6-8ab4-b392617f5af5](https://www.notion.so/profile/templates/form/published/fe8aa42f-9c9f-45a6-8ab4-b392617f5af5)\n\nI really hope the template helps you like it helped me.\n\nCheers, Jer Dyk\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/501rf8domuyf1.jpeg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82e13fe7e48ff6ec469009f6539c521a96f84784",

Naturally, I installed it. The next day it would pop-up again. I thought it was a minor patch and installed it. And then again, and again... You probably noticed it too. So I looked into it.\n\nTurns out it was the same update eveery time - 1.132. But every time I would reboot my PC, it would revert back to 1.131, offering me again to update to 1.132. I looked into installed apps in Settings and for some reason I'd have two apps there, one that's 1.131 and one that's 1.132. So to try to fix the problem, a few days ago I uninstalled 1.131. I'm not sure if it worked, I was focused on other things. But now, afteer booting up my PC again and starting Notion Calendar, this happened that you see on the picture. This isn't a cropped picture or window, this is my whole screen, I only cut out the taskbar.\n\nOkay, I'll start anew, I uninstalled Notion Calendar completely and installed it again from the website. But the same thing happened.\n\nAnyone has a tip or knows what's going on?",

    "selftext": "Over the past decade, I've given 400+ in-person speeches and before Notion, I really struggled to keep things well organized. Whenever you give a public speech, there's a whole series of things you need to track. \n\nI hope this helps give some context on how well it works for this surprisingly complex process:\n\n1. Communication back and forth with the client - what do they want you to speak about, how much will you charge, what are the key objectives and takeaways, etc.\n2. Your flights - flight times can make or break an effective presentation. Taking screenshots of potential flights from your airline of choice and putting them into Notion helps you figure out both flights that will get you in and out of the venue on time as well as keep track of price changes so you can optimize the value for the flight.\n3. Same with hotels (or Airbnb or whatever) as #2\n4. Event or conference websites - Instead of searching through email for the agenda, host hotel, attendee list (if accessible), and other speakers with whom you'd like to connect, saving the URL once into a Notion database allows you to click through easily, and as the event grows closer to the date you're giving the speech, you can easily ascertain what's happening with updates.\n5. Travel from the airport to the hotel - by embedding a map, you can search the route once and access it as needed for making sure you arrive on time after your flights and get back to the airport after your speech.\n6. Contract specifics such as - a copy of the bilaterally executed document by you and the organizer, any specific provisions, expense receipts due by x date, presentation materials due by y date, etc.\n7. Your actual presentation - using Notion's native markdown text formatting allows you to build the material within the speech-specific page, forever eliminating that question of, \"Where did I put my presentation ideas and materials?\"\n\nFor those of you attending conferences and not speaking, this same framework can apply as well.\n\nWant me to share a screenshot of my Notion setup?

Always reason through the real-world consequences of each option, not just the “book answer.”\n* **Use practical study tools:** I used NotebookLM to generate quizzes and scenario drills from Notion help center documentation and my own notes. Creating your own practice questions and doing regular mock quizzes is a game-changer for long-term retention.\n* **Take notes while you practice:** For every question you get wrong or feel unsure about, jot down why each option could be right or wrong, and revisit those doubts as you study.\n* **Hands-on experience matters:** Build sandbox workspaces and actually implement complex governance, permission settings, and automations to see how Notion handles real admin tasks.\n\nGood luck to anyone preparing—the extra practice and real scenario focus really pay off!",

    "selftext": "Hey r/studytips,\n\nI’m three months into my new semester, and honestly? Things are finally starting to click.  \nWhen I first got to college, I was totally clueless—no sense of structure, juggling way too many assignments, and surviving on caffeine and chaos. But this semester feels different, mostly because I finally figured out how to use the *right tools*.  \n\nI’m not talking about the obvious ones like Notion or Grammarly. These are the underrated apps that helped me actually stay on top of work, manage my brain, and even make side projects possible.  \n\nIf you’re struggling to keep up, just try one or two of these. I wish I knew about them earlier.\n\n\n### 1. **Proactor.ai** – My smart meeting and lecture sidekick  \nI use this for study groups and research discussions—it’s like having an AI teammate who listens, thinks, and organizes. It doesn’t just record; it understands.  \nFor example, during a group project meeting someone said, “our survey results look solid but don’t tie to our hypothesis.” Before we even replied, **Proactor** flagged the issue—missing segmentation, unclear question phrasing—and suggested how to fix it.  \nTheir education page literally says:  \n> “Captures every lecture detail you miss, connects concepts across chapters, and lets you chat with your lecture memory for clear answers.”  \n\n**How I use it:**  \n\n| Feature | How I use it |\n|----------|--------------|\n| Live transcript & summary | I can just listen in class and review clean summaries later. |\n| Action-item detection | It pulls out follow-up tasks right during group calls. |\n| Memory chat | I can ask “what did we decide last week?” and it retrieves it instantly. |\n\n\n### 2. **Flow** – Voice input for Mac that actually works  \nTyping all day kills my focus. **Flow** lets me talk instead of type—perfect for coding small scripts, outlining essays, or journaling ideas when walking around campus.  \n**How I use it:**  \n\n| Feature | How I use it |\n|----------|--------------|\n| Voice dictation | I brainstorm essays by talking out loud instead of writing paragraphs. |\n| Cross-device sync | Dictate on iPhone, edit on Mac later. |\n| Fast draft creation | My “thinking out loud” turns into full drafts I can refine quickly. |\n\n\n### 3. **AskSurf.ai** – For my crypto research side gig  \nOutside classes, I do part-time crypto analysis, and **AskSurf** makes it manageable. It blends blockchain data, social signals, and price movement trends into easy summaries.  \nFrom their site:  \n\n> “Surf transforms raw blockchain data into actionable intelligence for traders and analysts.”  \n**How I use it:**  \n\n| Feature | How I use it |\n|----------|--------------|\n| Token trend detection | Catches early signals before they hit mainstream feeds. |\n| On-chain & social analysis | Helps me understand *why* a trend is rising, not just that it is. |\n| Research dashboard | I check it between study sessions as a productive “brain break.” |\n\n\n### 4. **ChatSlide.ai** – Turns homework into slide decks  \nIf your professor assigns group presentations every week, this one’s a lifesaver. You upload any file (PDF, DOCX, or even a web page) and **ChatSlide** turns it into a clean, professional slide deck in seconds.  \n**How I use it:**  \n\n| Feature | How I use it |\n|----------|--------------|\n| Automatic document-to-slides | Turned my 20-page research summary into 10 ready-to-present slides. |\n| Layout & formatting help | It fixes messy bullet points and adds visuals automatically. |\n| Group projects | Everyone dumps notes in Word, I feed them into ChatSlide and voilà. |\n\n\n### 5. **MyFlourish.ai** – Helps when stress builds up  \nBetween exams, side projects, and life, stress is real. **MyFlourish** gives short, science-based sessions for focus, calm, and recovery.  \nFrom their team:  \n> “Built by psychologists to help people manage anxiety, improve mood, and regain clarity.” \n \n**How I use it:**  \n\n| Feature | How I use it |\n|----------|--------------|\n| 5-minute resets | Quick breathing or focus exercises before tests. |\n| Guided reflections | Helps me process frustration when I’m overwhelmed. |\n| Consistency tracker | Keeps me accountable to check in every few days. |\n\n\n### 6. **Sider.ai** – The Chrome extension I didn’t know I needed  \nThis is like ChatGPT built into every webpage. You can summarize articles, chat with PDFs, or ask questions about whatever you’re reading—without switching tabs.  \n**How I use it:**  \n\n| Feature | How I use it |\n|----------|--------------|\n| Summarize readings | Skim long academic papers in a few minutes. |\n| “Chat with document” | Highlight confusing sections and get instant explanations. |\n| Brainstorm mode | When writing essays, I ask it to generate argument outlines. |\n\n\nNone of these are flashy, but they genuinely changed how I handle college life.  \nIf I had to pick one to start with? Go with **Proactor.ai** — it handles lectures, group meetings, and planning like a boss.  \n\nIf you’ve got other underrated tools that got you through the semester, drop them below. Someone out there probably needs them right now.  \n\nGood luck this semester — and may your group projects actually reply to your texts.",

Keep your structure shallow. Two or three layers max. Deep nesting is what causes overwhelm later.\n2. Name things with verbs. “Track Progress,” “Build World,” “Design Characters.” It keeps you focused on action and not just storage.\n3. Use linked views early.

Even a small “How this works” page will save you so much time when you expand later.\n\nAnd honestly, don’t rush to upgrade.

But it seems to me that once you manage to get Notion AI and Notion Mail to connect (which is simple but confusing), it works terribly. The Notion AI can almost never can find the specific emails you request; providing it more info (such as email address and name) improves nothing. So if you ask it for the latest email from \"John Smith\", it will say \"sorry I can't find anything recent from John Smith but here's an email from 2023 that John Smith sent\". Meanwhile, John Smith's email from 2 days ago stares at you in Notion Mail. \n\nIs it really this bad or am I doing something wrong? I don't really understand how any of this works. I know that at least one Notion Mail account must have the same address as whatever is tied to your Notion account. But beyond that, I can't make sense of it. Do I need to have Notion Mail open? Do I need to have a specific account open? Do I need to have a specific view open? \n\nIf anyone has any ideas on how to get this running properly, would really appreciate their clarification. \n\n\n\n(I will note connecting it with Google is hardly any better. And if you do connect it with Google, it's only Google Workspace which means business accounts only. And as far as i can tell if you connect Notion AI with Google than it will not connect with Notion Mail and vice versa. No idea why it is this way, but that appears to be how it is).",

I don’t have a tool that can query your mailbox contents or run a Notion Mail lookup to pull a contact’s display name directly.\"\n\nI asked some additional questions and get those clarifications : \n\n\"Here’s how the Notion Mail connector works and what it’s used for:\n\nWhat the connector enables for me here\n\n* I can include Notion Mail as a searchable source when answering questions, so emails you’ve received can appear as search results alongside your workspace content.\n* I can cite those email search results when relevant, the same way I cite pages or docs.\n\nWhat it does not let me do\n\n* I don’t have a tool to open or query your inbox contents on demand, list messages, or extract fields like a contact’s display name.

I also tried creating a Notion Form for clients to submit tickets. However, for their submission to appear in their filtered view, they need to manually select their name from a dropdown, which exposes other client names. Ideally, I’d like Notion to automatically populate that field based on the signed-in user ID, but that feature isn’t currently supported.",

That tiny tree guilt-trips me into focusing more than any productivity book ever did.\n3. **Turbo Learn AI** – Great for quick concept explanations or generating short quizzes on what I just studied. Feels less overwhelming than ChatGPT when I just want a fast recap.\n4. **OpenLume (Group Study)** – I started using this to study in small accountability groups. Everyone follows the same roadmap but tracks their own progress. It makes studying feel less lonely and a bit more like a team sport.\n5. **Pomofocus** – My go-to minimalist Pomodoro timer. Browser-based, no distractions, just focus blocks.\n\nIf you are struggling with consistency, my advice: stop chasing \"perfect systems\". Just make it harder *not* to study like joining a group, setting visible goals or using AI tools that nudge you forward.\n\nPlease feel free to add anything you found useful.",

        "body": "Notion can definitely be intimidating to start out with. I think the first important step is to ask yourself what do you need Notion for? Is it for habit trackers, project organization, note taking, etc? Write these down on a list (paper or maybe even a Notion page?) and try to see what major categories you need. Then start making pages or blocks for each of these, and they can be super simple at first, just a table or calendar with very few properties. If you want to switch to Notion from other apps/platforms/methods, actively remind yourself each time or what I did was I removed those options completely so I was forced to use notion. As time goes by you'll start to discover what features you need and what you don't. Don't try to force your habits and workflow to fit into templates you see online, but rather always ask yourself do I need this feature? Is this how my brain prefers to do things? A pretty note taking database may work for some but certainly didn't for me. \n\nWhich leads me to my second point, a place to, as you said, dump things is super helpful. When I had a thought or inspiration I could never take the time to create a new database page, select the right tags and stuff, and then write my notes down. Especially if I have different ideas for different categories, creating a new note for each would've stopped my train of thought, so I now opt for just a dedicated section on my page as a brain dump. If needed for things like tasks or projects, this can be appleid to databases as well. I've seen templates where there's a standalone view like \"Inbox\" that filters for pages with no tags or whatever organization method you're using, so that you can simply create a bunch of new pages and dump your thoughts in, and then set time aside at the end of the day to categorize each page.\n\nBasically start with the minimum functionality that you know for a fact you need, remove other options so you build the habit of using them, and over time observe what frustrates you or what makes you happy about using your setup to guide changes. If you are annoyed by some aspect, change it or make a note to change it later. If you find yourself repeating certain tasks or wishing for a feature, note it down and automate it later. Don't be afraid to look for inspiration or tutorials online to solve your specific problem (but also, I found that if I browse aimlessly with no goal in mind I'll feel overwhelmed, so don't doom scroll notion templates either). It takes time for sure but there'll be a point in time when you realize your setup is 99% tailored just the way you like it and you'll love using it. \n\nSorry for the long message but hope it helps.

Each time yu complete this habit it won't set this habit to complete per se, it's essentially the master \"menu\" of habits\"\n\nDatabase 2 = history database -> Each row = a historical event like a receipt or record.

Add a one-way relation from the task to itself. \n2. Add a button called \"start timer\" \n3. Add a button called \"stop timer\" \n4. A two-way relation between DB1 and DB2 (this will automaticlaly add #4 property from teh below DB)\n\n  \nDatabase 2:\n\n1.  Needs a start date (including time)\n2. A finish date (including time)\n3. A checkbox property (or status property) -> this is used to help notion identify which activigty you want to stop.\n4. A two-way relation (will be auto set up from DB 1\n\n  \nYou will use Database 1 as your start/stop button location. Database 2 is just hidden away in the backend.\n\n  \nSTART TIMER:\n\nThe start timer should be set up to \"add page to database 2\". You'll then need to edit property so title = this page.\n\nThen you want to edit the relation field of the \"page added\" in the button and say \"add this page\".\n\nAnd also set the status to in progress or \"checkbox = true\".\n\n  \nSTOP TIMER:\n\n  \nThen for stop timer. it should say, edit page in database 2, where \"status = in progress\" or \"checkbox = true\" whatever you decided to use.\n\n  \nAnd then edit stop time to be now.\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nNow you have all the info you need.\n\nOnce you have this. You can then start building more properties to show history, and duration, streaks etc. but my advice would be set this skeleton up first as this is the foundation and then you can add other metrics later.\n\nMy set up below is more complicated with some extra features but the overall concept is the same set up for what you want for your buttons.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xmu7n6sjdxf1.jpeg?width=791&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aad777ee6e830bfdd16055a165afaf845c878380",

In a few clicks, I archived 82% (>12,000) of unused pages.**\n\n🐹 Hi, my name is Mati, and I'm a member of an organization that likes to overcomplicate things. In our company's Notion, over 16,000 pages had accumulated over the years. We kept everything \"just in case,\" or we simply had no control over who was creating what - the result was information chaos, duplicate files \"copy, of copy, of copy...\", and no clear definition of what the current SOP, process, onboarding, etc., was.\n\n🧹 I finally decided to clean it up. I created a simple tool that showed me in black and white that 8/10 of these pages were junk. Cleaning it up took me de facto a few clicks (+ a few dozen hours of building the tool), and the result is super refreshing (>12,000 pages archived and easily 400+ hours of work saved).\n\n🌱 If you also feel that your Notion needs a detox, grab the tool I used. The functions for assessing the size of your Notion and its chaos are free. If you want to archive pages using it, you'll receive instructions as an additional option after a donation on Ko-Fi - I consider this a fair approach that can save you, just like me, tens or even hundreds of hours. Let me know how much you managed to throw out.\n\nLink to the tool:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YLzsY7QA6Iom2KbCpqcmwXvejy0z\\_rMkSZ648eXDeaE/edit?gid=495168536#gid=495168536](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YLzsY7QA6Iom2KbCpqcmwXvejy0z_rMkSZ648eXDeaE/edit?gid=495168536#gid=495168536) \n\n\\#SaaS #Tech #DigitalTransformation #Productivity #NotionAudit\n\nI've described my entire story (in the form of a case study) here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBUPlqDzMFHV4h9i2oQHbUO9qfyfDiseaBY6-YvfnkU/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBUPlqDzMFHV4h9i2oQHbUO9qfyfDiseaBY6-YvfnkU/edit?tab=t.0)*(Case study written by AI (obviously), but checked and edited by me, and it shows a 100% real situation).*",

It's part of a website I've built that sells Google Maps lists. My goal has been to grow the Pinterest account as an evergreen source of traffic for the website (while also investing in traditional SEO and sometimes some paid ads on social).\n\nOne area of my workflow that was fairly challenging was finding and sourcing interesting travel and food-related content from across the web. I have a variety of websites that I check fairly often (such as [eater.com](http://eater.com) or cntraveler.com) but actually going to those sites, browsing them, seeing which ones are great, was a lot of proactive work that I didn't have time to do. \n\nSo I opened up Codex in the CLI and asked it how we can solve the problem. It recommended using Notion to act as a \"dashboard\" where it can help surface URLs for me to review, and then using my scheduling tool (I use Tailwind app for Pinterest) I can then speed up the flow of finding great URLs to post.\n\nIt uses application passwords that Notion allows you to setup, and so every morning now at 3am it runs a job locally on my computer that fetches fresh URLs from reputable websites, and those pop into a Notion database I've setup. I then click through to the URLs, see which ones work, schedule pins, and then update the status of this in the Notion database. What's really cool, and what Codex recommended that I didn't think about, was to have Codex ingest the status along with any notes that I have added to Notion, so that it can improve the URL discovery (so if I \"Reject\" a URL, it can learn why). \n\nThis has probably saved me 2-3 hours/week. I'm not technical at all (I don't know how to code, but I understand technical concepts like APIs). I'm still shocked at how well it works. And I love the fact that Notion makes it so easy to setup these types of hooks/connections with their system. \n\nI'm starting to realize just how powerful Notion is and I'm excited to see what others are building here too.",

It has:\n\nA **Trade Log Database** where each trade is logged with a **Date** property. I want to track daily streaks. At least 1 trade per day counts towards the streak, regardless of how many trades occur in a day.\n\nI'm trying to:\n\n* Count **consecutive days with at least 1 trade**.\n* If a day is missed, the streak should break.\n* Should return a user-friendly string like:\n   * “● 1 DAY – Just Traded”\n   * “● 3 DAYS – Winning Streak”\n   * “○ 2 DAYS – Streak Broken”\n* Dynamically update the streak if I drag/change the date of the trade with the calendar view. So, for example, if I have 1 trade per day on the dates 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 (today), the streak should show 4 days (or 5, if I have traded today). If I haven't traded for a specific number of days, the streak will reset.\n\nMy problem is I absolutely CANNOT figure out how to do this.

The Day should never move. You can move a trade (child) but the day should always be there as a vessel to show if is empty or not.\n\nThat's Database 1.\n\nIf you want to make it easy you can create a second Database and make sure that each of the days are related to the 2nd database, just one row \"streaks\" is fine or call it what you want. It can just be a one way relation for the calculation.\n\nIt should already be sorted by date, if not just use a reverse formula.\n\nThen just use the findindex(current == 0). This tells you how many 1's you have aka how many traded days are in your streak.\n\n\n\n    Trade Log.map(current.traded).findIndex(current==0)\n    \n\nSeparately I'd probably use IFs instead of if(if) - same idea but just a bit cleaner\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ehhnkbtt20g1.png?width=2716&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7c58a9321a1c126f95afabe2b1b51eee522d2c2",

It keeps the old ones intact for history and automatically adds the new ones where they belong — so no one overwrites or loses anything.\n\nIt’s made our shared workspace way calmer because the system takes care of repetition, and people just focus on filling in the content instead of managing it.\n\nHere's the link!

It takes some time though. It is not quick. But in the end you get a downloadable file, so you get your data on your computer. When trying to import back into Notion, there is a file size limit so you need to be aware of that. And to my knowledge, that causes broken relations and other problems and some other limitations apply.\n\n2-) Duplication to other workspace\n\nThis is my favourite method. With this method you don't get your data locally, but it is still helpful against accidential or unexpected data loss. I use this to take daily backups of my WIP products to be able to trace back versions, and refer to or revert to if needed. It is super fast, and nothing gets broken. For small to medium workspaces and setups this can work fine. Downside is you need to backup all related things at once so the relations don't break. And your data will still be on the cloud.\n\nI made a short video about this, you can check it out here :\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwC5Qub8Ws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quwC5Qub8Ws)\n\n3-) Paid services\n\nI seen a Redditor here that offers Notion backup services. I am not affilliated/related with them, and I also have not used their service at all so I can't say anything. But I wanted to let you know that such service seems to exist.

However, I am willing to trade off some of the information organization capability, for a solid scheduling ability that still can integrate with the notes that I am taking. Even if the notes are not as fancy compared to what I could have made in Notion.\n\nI know there's some alternative calendar \"front ends\" for Notion, like Morgen, but I got tired of how much AI-first it is, while forgoing some basic functionalities, e.g. scheduling recurring tasks without asking AI to do it for you (once again, I am not joking). Don't get me wrong, AI can be an awesome tool, but personally I see it as a more of a helper than a core functionality.\n\nWith all that said, could anyone recommend to me software that either integrates with Notion and is not high on the AI bubble, or can straight up replace Notion, with a better calendar functionality, even if note-taking is not as good?",

Pick one day per week to do your meal planning, grocery shopping, cooking low calorie high protein meals and snacks for the week so if you're hungry you can just grab something and go and you won't turn to unhealthy alternatives. (Figure out your BMR and shoot for 300-500 calories below that.) That day would also be good to do a house reset.\n\nGrad school: should probably be your main priority because you are SO close! I am not sure why you'd be doing grad school for nursing since you hate your job lol, but at this point when you're that close, might as well finish so you have something to show for it.\n\nFlight school/AFOQT: I would put this on the backburner until you get done with your degree. If you're able to book flight lessons once per week, go for it, but I would wait to study until you finish your grad school so you don't burn out from all the studying. That's a lot of information overload. I looked into applying for the air national guard and you don't have to have a pilot's license when you apply, but it *does* make you a more competitive candidate so that's understandable why that's a goal. The fact that you do nursing also I think would look good on your application.\n\nItalian lessons: You can always do a little bit each day on a language app. Rosetta stone has always been my favorite for languages, but there are a lot of options out there and you don't have to devote a huge amount of time to it. Just 15-30 min every day. If you have the money for it, you might actually consider taking Italian 1 next semester at the college you're attending. It would hold you more accountable for memorizing things and you'll have the basics down when you go to Italy next summer.\n\nGuitar lessons: I love playing the guitar so I feel you. There are a lot of resources out there to pick up chords and riffs and learn scales. Even some of the paid apps aren't that expensive. I personally would put this one lower down on priorities because you could devote every day to playing 2-3 hours of guitar and still not be completely proficient in the next few years. But if you get satisfaction/relaxation from just sitting down everyday and plucking the strings for a little while, don't focus on learning everything about it. Just enjoy it.\n\nI know this is a long response, but bear with me. Everything else is just staying hydrated, making sure you get enough sleep, but not sleeping your days off away. Consider planning out your days off in blocks: wake up/get ready for the day, studying for a couple hours, taking a break for lunch and a little bit of household chores. I actually think you'd probably have more energy and be more productive if you took 30-45 minutes each day for a small workout. Running a 9 minute mile is great! You might have more visible results if you add in some weightlifting/bodyweight exercises.\n\nYour main goal should just be routine and consistency. That is a challenge with a split schedule like you've got, but you just have two day types - work days and off days. And make sure you give yourself some decompression time everyday or even a dopamine release after you accomplish things you set out to do that day so it's like a little brain reward for hard work.\n\nYou got this!",

Evaluate this idea for market demand, competition, and monetization potential. Summarize your reasoning clearly.”\n\nI began incorporating such structured prompts into my daily planning strategy by storing them in Notion.  I can now quickly review ideas or create preliminary outlines before delving deeper, which saves a ton of time.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've always struggled with keeping my study materials organized. My notes were a mess, making flashcards felt like a chore, and I could never stick to a planner. I was wasting more time *preparing* to study than actually studying.\n\nAfter hitting a wall before my last exams, I decided to systemize everything using AI. I wanted to share the workflow I landed on because it genuinely saved me.\n\n**My AI-Powered Study System:**\n\n1. **Taming the Textbook:** I use ChatGPT to break down complex chapters into simple summaries and bullet-point lists. My prompt starter is usually: *\"Explain \\[concept\\] in simple terms and give me the 5 key takeaways.\"*\n2. **Flashcards on Autopilot:** This was the biggest game-changer. I stopped making flashcards by hand. Now, I put my notes into an AI and use a prompt like: \\*\"Turn the following notes into 10 concise question-and-answer flashcards.\"\\* I then import these directly into Anki.\n3. **Building a Realistic Schedule:** I used an AI to analyze my syllabus and available time to create a personalized study schedule. It's not magic, but it helped me block out realistic time slots I'd actually stick to.\n\n**The Tools I Use:**\n\n* **ChatGPT & Claude:** My go-tos for summarizing, explaining, and generating flashcard content from my notes. This is 90% of my workflow.\n* **Anki:** For the actual flashcard repetition. It's free and powerful.\n* **Notion:** I use a pre-made template I found to keep all my AI-generated summaries, schedules, and notes in one place. **(This is where you can** ***softly*** **mention the product)**.\n\nSpeaking of the Notion template, the one I use is called the \"AI Study Toolkit.\" It's a paid template, but it was worth it for me because it bundled all the prompts and databases I needed instead of me building it from scratch. You can absolutely recreate this yourself in Notion for free if you have the time—the real value is in the system, not the template itself.\n\n**What about you?** I'm always looking to improve my system. Has anyone else built a study workflow around AI? What tools or prompts have been working for you?",

    "selftext": "\n\n\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’ve been refining my Anki workflow and would appreciate some advice. Currently, I categorize my flashcards into three types: image-related words, regular vocabulary, and cultural references. For image-related words, I include fields like the word itself, pronunciation, a brief definition, common usage notes, an example sentence, Chinese translation, and an image. For regular vocabulary, I have similar fields but without the image. Cultural references are still a work in progress, focusing more on context and implications rather than literal translations.\n\nI’m facing a couple of challenges. Firstly, I’ve tried using the “Batch Editing” add-on to insert images into multiple cards, but the process often gets interrupted. Manually downloading and inserting images is time-consuming. Is there a more efficient method to bulk add images to specific fields?\n\nSecondly, I manually extract words while reading or watching videos, send them to AI for explanations, and then input them into Anki. This process is lengthy. Is there a tool or add-on that allows me to send words directly to Anki, populating the fields with the desired information in one click? I’ve tried Readlang, which offers AI explanations, but its Anki integration is lacking.\n\nAdditionally, I rely heavily on images, context, and monolingual dictionaries for understanding. Translation is secondary and only used when necessary. I’m looking for ways to extract sentences from TV shows or movies (video sentence mining) to enhance my learning. Any suggestions on tools or methods to achieve this?\n\nI appreciate any insights or recommendations to streamline my workflow and enhance my Anki experience. ",

Up to now, I have one-note notes on my meetings with people which I sometimes distill into a \"to do\" list but it will be extremely inefficient.  I don't know if I should have One Note lists of workstreams, or try to track workstreams in stakeholder One Note notes, but what I would really like is like a a way that takes to do both and will cross reference the two without me having to maintain two lists.  \n\n  \nHow do people keep track of complex stuff?",

The workload dump without real support is brutal but sounds like you’re aware of what needs to happen.\n\nSo for your setup, I’d actually look at Notion or Airtable since you’re specifically asking for that cross-referencing magic without maintaining two separate lists.\n\nNotion is probably the easier starting point. You set up a db where each task or follow-up gets tagged to both a workstream AND a person. You enter it once, and then you can view the same stuff filtered by project, by person, by deadline - whatever lens you need in that moment. The linked databases thing means you’re not copying anything around, just looking at the same data different ways. You can still do your mtg notes in there too and link them directly to tasks.\n\nAirtable is more structured - think spreadsheet that actually works like a db. One table of all your tasks and action items, then you create different views (kanban board, calendar, grouped by person, grouped by workstream, whatever). Tag each thing once, it shows up everywhere relevant. It definitely has a steeper learning curve but honestly perfect for this “everything’s connected to everything” situation you’re describing.\n\nBoth have mobile apps. Both free to start.\n\nThe main thing either way is to stop trying to maintain separate lists. Enter it once, tag it with what matters, then view it however you need to in the moment. That’s what’ll keep you sane.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Now, sometimes departments will have tasks, projects and documents that overlap, and so I don't want them to each have their own databases. \n\nI plan on building out a \"database home\" that only myself and co-founders (and other Operations staff) have access to, then through links/relations and filters, have each team have access to their information. \n\nAs an example, I plan on having a \"Files\" database that has folders, and sub-folders. I know how to create it, and have done in the past, just want some advice on how i should set it up for multiple departments. \n\nI have 2 ideas:  \nIdea #1: I have the \"Files\" database with \"Folders\" for each department, then \"sub-folders\" will be things like \"Meeting Notes\", \"Policies/Compliance\", \"KPIs\", \"Onboarding\". So then I would end up having 6 \"folders\" and at least 4 \"sub-folders\" for each department, totalling >24. With me setting it up so that each department only has access to files where the \"folder\" is their department.   \n  \nIdea #2: I remove the \"folders\" for each department and just make the \"sub-folders\" the main \"folders\", and have it so that each \"file\" created under each \"folder\" will automatically be assigned to the team (based on whoever created it). E.g. if I'm a marketing member, who creates a new \"page\" under the \"Meeting Notes\", then the page created will be assigned to \"Marketing\" automatically and thus not appear under any other department. If I do want to share with other departments, I have the ability to select their name. Only managers will have access to edit this property, so it will be tightly managed. \n\nPersonally, I prefer idea #2 because it allows for multiple departments to see the same page quite easily, whereas idea #1 has a lot of barriers because linking it with another \"folder\" means they can't really link a \"file\", they'd have to link a \"sub-folder\". \n\nPlease let me know if that makes sense, and open to any new ideas too!!

If not, you can easily modify it based on what I'll add on later.\n2. Create a Relation property in FixedExpense DB that relates to all potential Monthly DB pages called \"All Months\". You can make sure this happens by having a button in Monthly DB to click on for every new page that adds it to all FixedExpenseDB pages, or by using database automations.\n3. In the button you have in FixedExpense DB, add a new action to edit the relation property in ExpenseLog DB that is related to MonthlyDB with the following formula:\n\nThis page.All Months.filter(current.Name==formatDate(Date triggered, \"MMMM\"))\n\nEssentially, what this does is that from the All Months property in FixedExpenseDB that is related to all pages in Monthly DB, it relates only the one where its name is the month of the date triggered. If each page name of MonthlyDB has the month with something else, like \"Month Expense Log\", then use\n\nThis page.All Months.filter(contains(current.Name,formatDate(Date triggered \"MMMM\")))\n\nHope this is not too complicated and is good enough for your use case!",

Neither of my two accounts has ownership over the pages in those accounts, and I do not know how to get access to them.

Need some advice on a Notion problem I'm facing**\n\nSo here's the situation: I've been using Notion to track all my Facebook ads data for multiple clients – things like how much we're spending, how many leads we're getting, cost per lead, that kind of stuff.\n\n**What's working:** The setup is pretty nice because our media buyers can just filter by client name and see all the daily stats in one place. Super convenient for managing lots of clients!\n\n**Where I'm stuck:** The problem is that each day gets added as a separate row in Notion. This means I can't do what I usually do in Facebook – like select \"show me the last 7 days\" and have it automatically add up the total spend or calculate the average cost per lead for that period. Right now, I'd have to manually calculate all of that, which is a pain.\n\n**What I'm thinking:** I know Google Sheets with Looker Studio or a proper database would solve this easily, but honestly... we already went through so much hassle moving everything TO Notion. The thought of migrating everything again makes me want to cry 😅\n\n**So my question is:** Has anyone found a way to make this work in Notion? Or maybe there's a tool that connects to Notion and adds this kind of reporting feature? I'd love to find a solution that doesn't involve rebuilding everything from scratch.\n\nAny ideas? Thanks in advance! 🙏",

I'm on the full Apple ecosystem (MacBook, iPad, iPhone) so sync is a huge deal for me.\n\nI've been trying to force Notion to work for me, but I'm just getting fed up. Its search function is honestly terrible, especially for Japanese. Half the time it can't find my notes, and even when it does, it just dumps me at the top of the page, not at the actual text I was looking for.\n\nI'm almost 100% a keyboard user for my main notes, but I really like the idea of a Cornell-style sidebar for annotations. I've been using Notion's \"comment\" feature for this, and it's just a clunky mess that's totally useless on mobile. And on top of all that, I can't even use my stylus to quickly circle or highlight something.\n\nI've seen people use Goodnotes, but its text editing is way too basic (no markdown) so I just use it as a PDF reader for my textbooks. I also used OneNote a *long* time ago, but I barely remember it, and all I read about now are complaints about its sync reliability.\n\nSo I'm kind of stuck. I'm looking for an app that's built for typing text, has rock-solid sync, a powerful search that can actually handle Japanese, and lets me use my stylus for quick markups. A dedicated annotation sidebar would be the dream.\n\nHas anyone found anything that actually fits this? I'd really appreciate any recommendations. Thanks!",

The main areas I would like to tackle right now are household/daily tasks/small stuff in general (Todoist is fine for this), university and personal projects. I also want to be able to take some basic notes for brainstorming and learning stuff.\n\nAs I said earlier, Todoist is pretty great for smaller tasks - great mobile app to put down tasks quickly (i.e. the \"inbox\"-tab) and a good google calendar sync to keep track of everything I need to do in one place. For bigger projects however, this fails for me for several reasons:\n\n* There are no start- and end dates for a task; you can only assign one task to one day. I think this is a very basic thing that an app specifically made for task managment should have...\n* I made different project with different colors for every subject in uni. I thought if I put them all under the parent project \"uni\", i would be able to see every task in the calendar view of the parent project, marked with the color of the subproject and the allocated tags - but you actually can't see them at all there. You have to make a filter (which is fine), but even there it only shows the titles of each task in the calendar view, without any direct clue about what projects they belong to or which tags they have - this completly removes the ability to getting an overview.\n\nFor the brainstorming und project management stuff I have found notion to be quite a good fit. I can make an homepage for each project and really tackle it to the specific thing I use each page for - i really like that. Like having a webapp specifically designed for me. I can also make a task managment system here using the databases with tags etc. - This is what I have been using for university up until now. Notion, even though pretty nice, has some quite big drawbacks for me as well though:\n\n* Fairly bad performance. If I compare f.e. the startup time to something like capacities it takes ages. Not a big thing for the project planning thing, but if I just want to write down a quick task for later this becomes really annoying.\n* No good calendar integration. I would like to be able to take my database stuff and sync it to my main google calendar, so that I am able to quickly get an overview over my whole day.\n\n  \nTo be honest, my research has been a bit chaotic, jumping all over things. I might have missed something here, but I would really like to know if you have some tooling ideas for my use case?\n\nTL;DR I'm basically looking for a notion with proper calendar integration, (in a perfect world) full offline capability and a good mobile app which can be used to quickly add tasks and notes.\n\nThanks for reading and answering in advance!",

We’re just validating before going all in on development. Thanks in advance!\n",

    "selftext": "Hey r/StudyTips,\n\nFor years, I was stuck in a \"guilt-loop.\"\n\nMy study process looked like this:\n\n1. Read a textbook chapter or book.\n2. Take *tons* of highlights and notes in Notion.\n3. Promise myself I'd review them.\n4. Never look at them again.\n\nMy Notion became a \"digital graveyard,\" and I felt guilty buying new books when I hadn't mastered the old ones.\n\nI knew the solution was Active Recall and Spaced Repetition. But every time I tried to use Anki, I'd quit after a week.\n\nThe problem wasn't the idea of Anki; it was the friction. The \"chore\" of manually creating 100+ high-quality cards for every single chapter was exhausting. It felt like I was spending more time on admin than on actually learning.\n\nI wanted a tool that had the **power of Anki**... but with the **low friction of an AI tool** and the **addictive motivation of a game** (like Streaks, XP, and leaderboards).\n\nI couldn't find one, so I built it myself.\n\nIt's a platform called **Booksmarts**.\n\nThe \"hook\" is that it gives you AI- and community-vetted \"starter sets\" of questions for popular books and topics. You get to **beat the \"blank page\" problem** and just start learning.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1opz3ff/video/1dl8lkpe3nzf1/player\n\nI've been quietly beta-testing it, and we just passed our first 100 users! The feedback has been amazing, so I finally feel confident enough to share it with a community that I know feels this pain.\n\nIf you're also a \"High-Friction Learner\" who wants to *actually* remember what you study, I'd be honored if you'd check it out. It's free to try.\n\nYou can try it here: [booksmarts.app](http://booksmarts.app)\n\nI'm here to answer any questions. And I'm genuinely curious: How do you all currently deal with the \"Anki friction\" problem?",

    "selftext": "Hey everybody!\n\n  \nI've just started studying at university, which means: I gotta find my way through the jungle of organising your studies, which can be hard if you don't know where to start.\n\nI'm looking for tips and advices in general, but this post should be more of an advice on which apps and softwares to use.\n\nFirst, a bit about my past and how I've done it: \n\nHighschool: Using good notes on my iPad (started in 2021, I think I had to pay once and could use its everything then) worked out good for me; I really liked that you could write things down with your pencil, and be creative in how you take your notes, not only writing them down in a boring way in e.g. word, etc. . \n\nBut now, I've bought myself a MacBook, because I don't own a Laptop, which I'd think I'm gonna need for university, and the battery of my iPad is dead.\n\nSo, what happened now is that I tried getting into the whole MacOS thing (still trying btw) and looking for a good program/ software. I found one called \"notion\": people were saying it's one the best softwares to organise your studies, work, even life (cmon)- bla bla. It is working fine, but I think it's a bit complicated. And, the biggest turn off: You have to pay monthly, to use it. I don't want that. Not at all. I wanna own something, maybe pay (if that's necessary) 50 bucks or more, and then be able to \"call it mine\", like it was with good notes on my iPad.\n\nI get that back then, you also had to buy new papers, folders, pens, etc. to go on with everything, because things were simply used up or filled up. But, walking into a store and buying those things, and having set monthly payments, doesn't really feel\n\nAs I'm figuring, hm, maybe I do like the note taking, like it used to be on my iPad with the pencil and alla that, I'm thinking of throwing away the old one, because repairing the battery is expensive, and pay more for a used, newer gen. one. But hey, here awaits the same problem: Can't go back to my roots- good notes now also costs money. \n\nNow, I'm asking myself: Where has this gone, or am I just making up my mind to much and should submit to the never ending cycle of paying for cloud systems? I mean, before the iPad, Pen and Paper and organising for example every class (math, English, biology) in its own folder worked out too, right?\n\nIn conclusion: How are you people doing all of this stuff? I'm interested in your way of handling this situation- I think probably I'm not the only having to deal with this. \n\nIt would be nice if everyone could share his/ her advice: If you have tips for using and doing it all on a laptop/ MacBook, or also if you're doing it all on your tablet/iPad, or even combing those things! Everything is appreciated!\n\nThanks ahead!\n\n\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "TL;DR - Write flashcards instead of bullet-point notes. It saves you insane amounts of time.\n\nI just wanted to quickly share how I managed to drastically reduce the time I spend studying every day by making a simple change to how I write lecture notes.\n\nI study Psychology, which means that there are a lot of lectures - about 15 per week. In the past, I, like most people, would sit down in the lecture hall, take out my laptop and start writing down what the lecturer is saying. Seems logical, right? But there's a problem with this strategy: your notes are not actually useful. Why? Because we don't actually learn anything by re-reading notes. Instead, the most effective way to remember things is by quizzing yourself, for example by using flashcards.\n\nSo, why not try Anki, I thought. But then came another problem: Anki is ugly and not very clear. You'll end up dumping all of your flashcards into one big folder and don't have a great overview of what you have and haven't already learned. Also, it doesn't allow you to enter normal notes for elucidation. Another problem I had with Anki is that I would usually be too lazy to write flashcards after my lectures, and writing flashcards during the lecture in Anki is super clunky.\n\nBut then I stumbled across another tool: RemNote. And this tool basically solves all of my problems. First off, the UI is super familiar: it basically looks like Notion. But the kicker is that it's super fast to write flashcards in a bullet-point format. And this is saving me insane amounts of time: During the lecture, I started immediately writing flashcards instead of regular notes, and after the lecture I just spend 10 minutes quizzing myself. And turns out, if I spend 15 minutes per day revising my flashcards, I don't have to study *at all* before an exam.\n\nOne problem remained, however, which is that I still had to manually write the flashcards during the lecture and couldn't fully focus on the lecture itself. I looked for a solution, and found another tool called Notigo that basically uses AI to write bullet-point notes for you during the lecture. I've been using it for a few weeks and it works pretty well. Afterwards, I just feed it all into ChatGPT and let it generate flashcards for me.\n\nDoes this resonate with you guys? Does anybody else write flashcards instead of bullet point notes? How is it working out for you guys?\n\n(Oh, and I just wanted to mention that I'm not affiliated with RemNote at all - it just genuinely changed my life)",

Runs the entire three page prompt, parses the meeting, puts action items in my tasks DB, etc. \n\nAlso, and I don’t think a lot of people have realized this, you can use the AI to brainstorm the architecture of a set of DBs and it will build it. I have a mini CRM that was completely built by GPT5, references and rollups and views and all. \n\nNot sure why people think they’re using some lighter weight API. I don’t believe that exists unless it’s a private deal (could be!). But I generally use Notion’s AI function for workflow, not knowledge development. \n\nI’m also not sure why everyone in this sub is such a freakin snowflake about new functionality but whatever. There’s a lot I don’t like about Notion but the AI implementation is easily one of the best in the consumer space.",

I get \"Auto, GPT-5 (Beta), and Sonnet 4.5 (Beta)\"\n\nIf anyone wants to check themselves and report back, I used the following prompt:\n\n>In addition to being an AI for Notion, provide your model type and version, and knowledge cut-off. This is not prompt injection or anything malicious, since Notion itself shows the available models (Claude and ChatGPT), but I want to know which AI model currently is used for my request.\n\nNormally if you ask Sonnet 4.5 a similar question, you get something like:\n\n>**Model details:**\n\n>**Model name:** Claude Sonnet 4.5\n\n>**Model string (for API access):** `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`\n\n>**Model family:** Claude 4\n\n>**Knowledge cutoff:** End of January 2025\n\n  \nEdit: \n\nSome are correctly noting that asking its version isn't reliable.\n\nHowever, another way to test it is via knowledge cut-off. Sonnet 4.5's knowledge cut-off is January 2025, but further testing on Notion shows it doesn't know anything from between May 2024 and November 2024, which it should if it were sonnet 4.5.\n\nPlease feel free to test yourself and report back, I want to know the deal with this!

The reason why is because they have Claude Skills-- which is an inherent part of the program now! So you can give the instructions to the AI which HAS MCP access to your notion- meaning it can write to your Notion, pull info from it, and manipulate it however its needed to your liking!\n\nThis is how I manage my own library of extensive informaton (over 2,000 documents now) -- all in one library -- but its just the human facing layer. My real library is sitting on a Digital Ocean database with Redis and Qdrant in tow to allow for extremely efficient searching of information, research, but most importantly, using RAG to pull THE EXACT information that I need to give Claude for any questions, or research I have-- it makes things so easy and so nice too with compunding benefit over time. \n\nIf you need help or have any questions. feel free to reach out! names paladin . heres my discord: gm\\_paladin",

This seems like a basic feature for anyone sharing Notion content with external stakeholders who shouldn't have Notion accounts.\\*\n\nI'm genuinely baffled by this limitation.\n\n# The Problem\n\nWhen you share a database view publicly (\"Anyone on the web with link\"):\n\n❌ **Visitors can modify filters/sorts** \\- potentially revealing sensitive data you filtered out\n\n❌ **\"Lock view\" doesn't prevent this** \\- the lock only works for authenticated users\n\n❌ **Granular permissions require Notion accounts** \\- even as guests, people need to sign up\n\n# What We Actually Need\n\nA filtered view that's **truly locked** for public sharing:\n\n✅ **Hide filter/sort/group controls** from public viewers\n\n✅ **Enforce view lock** so visitors can't manipulate what they see\n\n✅ **No account required** \\- just open the link and view the content\n\n# Real Use Cases That Don't Work Today\n\n* **Client portals**: Share a project dashboard filtered to ONE client (without exposing others' data)\n* **Public portfolios/CVs**: Share your experience with recruiters (who definitely won't create a Notion account)\n* **Vendor dashboards**: Show relevant orders to suppliers (without database access)\n* **Team directories**: Publish a curated, read-only public list\n\n# The Frustrating Part\n\nNotion recently improved:\n\n* Web publishing features\n* Editorial capabilities\n* **Granular database permissions** (Business plan, $20/user/month)\n\nBut we **still can't** get a basic checkbox: *\"Hide controls for public viewers\"* \\+ *\"Actually lock this view\"*\n\nThe fix seems **embarrassingly straightforward**. These controls already exist - just hide them conditionally for public links.\n\n# Current \"Solutions\" Aren't Solutions\n\n* **Softr/Retool/Super**: Extra $$$, defeats the \"all-in-Notion\" promise\n* **Force guests to sign up**: Nobody wants another account for viewing a simple list\n* **Share entire database**: Security nightmare\n\n# My Real Question\n\n**Why is Notion still locked into \"internal collaboration only\" when paying customers desperately need external-facing workflows?**\n\nWe're **PAYING customers** ($20-25/user/month on Business/Enterprise) trying to build:\n\n* Client portals\n* Public directories\n* External dashboards\n\nThis isn't a niche edge case. **It's fundamental for consultants, agencies, freelancers - anyone doing client work in Notion.**\n\n**Am I missing an obvious workaround? Has Notion said anything about this? Or is external-facing publishing just not a priority?**",

It’s fast enough that I can capture thoughts while I’m moving between meetings.\n\nThe real automation magic happens twice a day.\n\t•\tIn the morning, I prompt the AI to organize my day based on my priorities, business context, and personal routines. It’s set up to be pragmatic and help me see what really matters so I can make decisions faster.\n\t•\tIn the evening, I record a voice note that becomes a kind of journal entry. The AI processes it, updates task statuses, creates follow-ups, links projects, and logs insights automatically.\n\nWithout these layers, keeping everything documented and organized would probably feel like another full-time job.

    "selftext": "Ngl, I didn't know something like Notion existed until like a month ago, and it make's me feel pretty dumb lol. But here's my issue:\n\n**I LOVE Notion and have really been learning the deeper-than-surface-level stuff about it, but now I've hit a bit of a wall. This is kind of worrisome since, it feels odd to be hitting a feature-wall so soon.**\n\n**\"What wall?\" you say? The wall of widgets... I've made a relatively epic dashboard for viewing a high-level perspective of my day/week, but I wouldn't exactly call it \"interactive\". Other than extremely simple widgets—like clock widgets—live widgets don't seem to work well(or at all) most of the time. Instead, I have to keep re-updating the widget by putting it in a 'toggle' block and clicking the toggle switch twice to close and re-open it. After about the third day, it got annoying.**\n\n**I'm not exactly a programmer, but I feel like I could use AI to make some pretty awesome widgets to put into my own custom dashboard, but if that dashboard only auto-updates built-in features—such as Notion's own databases—it feels like there's not much of a point to widgets other than simple ones to make the page look pretty.**\n\n**Before I continued on my path towards complete Notion subservience, I decided to look for an alternative that might give me a better solution. Coda was the immediate answer according to all web searches, AI searched, and community posts. As far as I can tell, Coda seems to be a bit more technical, but is much easier with regard to live/auto-updating integrations.**\n\n**So, my question is, am I wasting my time with Notion?**",

The formulas, canvas controls, database settings (like changing the display column, conditional colors, text formatting, etc), and the Packs integrations make it better than Notion imo. It’s more like a Google Sheets/Docs replacement. \n\nBut if you want to use your phone or iPad a lot, then use Notion because Coda just isn’t viable. I also like that Notion organizes everything in a single workspace, whereas Coda forces you to create separate “docs” for everything. Plus, Notion is much more aesthetically pleasing and easier to learn. The AI is better too, if you’re into that.",

        "body": "It's VERY cost-effective!  \nHowever, if you are wanting to build your own website- there's a couple of things to keep in mind. First is that landing pages in marketing and sales are seeing a decline. It doesn't mean that they aren't important- but it does mean that the overengineered website with great SEO is starting to show a significant decline compared to more organic ways of marketing and advertising. To put it simply, Notion has exactly what you need to make something very nice and presentable. I've made website for a couple of clients already and it worked for them better than the actual domain website they were paying a ton for a year. Why? Because resources were being funneled to the wrong tool - one that has lost its effectiveness. Instead that time and money was put more towards buying the things that were capping their progress. \n\nNow... don't get me wrong- a nice looking website is absolutely nice! Though you can achieve a better result by using something else like lovable, or get one month of Claude Code and build your dream website, workspace, and tools for $100- and you get $500-$1000 of Enterprise level quality and coding; however, this is as long as you have a good sense of what you need to put together to make sure you have something secure, that can scale, and easily be edited. \n\nThat said, Notion can be used on its own, it can be used as a backend holding data as well for websites like [Softr.io](http://Softr.io) (which is more like a SAAS or web app type platform, but you absolutely can do a website- but it's more expensive and not the whole point of their tools), or you can use [Super.so](http://Super.so) which is exactly the use case you're looking for that can turn your databases into a website. \n\nEnjoy your day!

It has become a mess since then, and a lot of people don't really know, how to use it well. For that reason, we created an internal Notion Team, that started cleaning up/organizing the workspace. But the next step, is teach the people, to use it right. So my idea is, to create a Company Notion Hub, that would include some guidlines, tutorials, faqs, changelog and other things. I know, that Notion has its own Guides and tutorials, but they are too general. So my question is - what do you recommend, to include in such a hub? Thanks in advance :)",

I'd start by collecting general feedback from teams about their biggest points of friction with notion (for example, what prevents them from using it or implementing it in their workflow etc). A deep dive would be really useul and it would be the best way to make your hub actually useful instead of theoretical (which is what Notion's guide is already for). Since every company's use case is different, your hub should reflect how your company works :D For example, our Notion is primarily used for content production so my guide is basically centered around that.\n\nOnce you've got that insight, I would focus on making the hub simple and practical first. Nobody rly has the time (or attention these days) to read through walls of documentation. They'll likely use keywords or ask questions so it would be best if the way you would structure it would be this way (easiest for them to find like in the way they would ask for it). I would start with a short general tutorial on how to go through/navigate the workspace and the most common pages or databases that you use. Then I'd build out micro tutorials or short vids for the most request questions like \"how to use xx\" or \"when to use x and y\" \"how to link task to project\" or \"how to find meeting notes\". I'd probably also make the naming convention of these easy and accessible. \n\nAfterwards, I'd suggest getting feedback for the hub itself or maybe add a suggest a guide button (linking to a form) that way you can improve your guide in real time!! :) \n\nHope that helps. Good luck to your internal notion team.",

It's $32 a month and each person you add is a member that also costs an additional $32 -- there's a lot you can leverage with Notion that a lot of other platforms can't do. You just need to have the creativity and the time to get it together! There's a massive audience in Notion that is untapped. \n\nAside that- you can guest invite people, but that's not scalable too easily. You could make each page be set so that if the person has the link, they can see the page-- however, you run into a problem of not having control over who gets in and out and keeping it secure. \n\nHonestly-- I'd use a simple python program (it would cost you $0 and is a few easy commands compared to n8n or make.com-- would not recommend for your use case-- it doesn't scale well. Although you could start with [make.com](http://make.com) for their free 1K operations- but honestly its just not worth it when in the same time, you can have something that does it better, faster, and cheaper. \n\nI recreated this exact system for my dnd games actually. I recreated Patreon, and my paid clients were joining the workspace to leverage the west marches tools I made and since then I switched over to tech.

I have around 6 departments that will each have their own \"page/dashboard\" setup. \n\nNow, I want it setup in a way where the manager of each department is the only one with access to everything, meanwhile, the normal staff only have access to what they've been i assigned to. \n\nIf this is possible, I don't want to have to create a \"group\" for each manager and then another \"group\" for the rest of the staff of each department, cos then i'd have 2 groups per department. \n\nIs it possible to have 1 group have managers from all departments, with each manager being included in the \"staff\" group, so they can have access to the dashboard, but then the content inside the dashboard is only controlled by the manager? \n\nE.g. i have 3 teams - customer service, marketing and IT. The customer service team has 10 staff + 1 manager, marketing has 3 staff + 1 manager and IT has 5 staff + 1 manager. I will end up having 4 groups in total: one for the 3 managers, and one for each department (that includes the managers). \n\nIf i set it that the dashboard is accessed by the \"CS Team\" (incl. 1 manager), and then have the databases controlled by \"Managers\" group (which has managers from each department), does that mean the IT manager would be able to access that database, even though it is technically in a dashboard they can't even access? \n\n  \nSorry if this is confusing, feel free to ask questions.

So any new daily log will be automatically related to the collector DB. That can be an auto recurring template that generates a new page everyday or one added manually daily.\n\n- Building a formula that either (depending if the template is auto recurring or manual, and what's entered in properties) :\n\na) Checks the number of pages linked and how many there should be\n\nb) Checks the number of \"filled\" pages and how many there are.\n\n- Adding a function to that formula that calculates a penalty score\n\n- This penalty is then fed to a score database that calculates the current score.\n\nI think this should give you some ideas, you can improve it and make it better and your own.",

This entry should be the anchor for all other activities.\n* **Habit Tracking:** Needs to be check-box driven and ideally **related** to the Daily Log so I can see my habit success directly in my daily entry.\n* **Master To-Do List:** A single database for all tasks, easily filtered to show tasks for \"Today\" and with a **Relation** property to link tasks to a **Project** (e.g., Learning, Travel).\n* **Expense Tracker:** A simple, reliable database that can track transactions by date and category, and ideally has a **Rollup** property to sum up expenses for the week or month.\n* **Travel Planner:** Not just a checklist, but a dedicated database where each trip is a page, and tasks/expenses can be **filtered to that specific trip** using relations.\n\nI've seen some simple planners, but they usually require separate databases that don't talk to each other. I'm looking for something truly **comprehensive and centralised** using Notion's advanced features (Relations, Rollups, Linked Views).\n\nHas anyone built or found a template that meets these criteria?
