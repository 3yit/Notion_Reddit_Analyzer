I urge everyone to STOP using Notion.

I spent entire days creating a database and just as I was rolling it out to guests, I got BANNED… for no apparent reason, with no explanation, no recourse AND THEY WON’T GIVE ME BACK MY OWN DATA!!

This is pure fucking evil 

I warned you. STOP USING NOTION

## 3. My routine that finally worked

**📝 Full Post Content:**

> Hello people of Reddit, 

I wanted to share my routine that honestly completely changed my life, from being an unfocused, permanently tired, undisciplined, overweight mess to someone who’s finally productive, stable, and actually proud of herself.

I even got promoted twice this year. Some of the things I changed sound kind of weird, but they worked for me.



A bit about me

I’m 26, F, working in IT as a product manager.
The last few years were rough - always exhausted, zero motivation, my relationship fell apart because I was basically just existing.

After the breakup, I spiraled: gained weight, got depressed, and my performance at work tanked.
My 2024 review was the worst I’d ever had, and I was this close to being put on a PIP.

So on Jan 1st, I told myself: this is it. 

Why I’m writing this

I used to read this sub all the time, hoping to find something that would click.
I tried everything - journaling, Notion setups, time blocking, 75 Hard, bullet journaling, whatever.

Some of it helped a bit, most didn’t.

This year, things finally did click.
I’m writing this because I wish I’d seen a post like this last year - something that actually worked in real life.

Final caveat: this is what worked for me after months of experimenting. But that’s it A it works for ME. I’m not advocating for everyone following the same thing to do T. Use common sense, adjust to your situation. Your mileage may vary.


My routine

Wake up: 5:00 AM sharp.
First week was torture, second week my body started doing it automatically. I don’t even need an alarm now. Read up about circadian rhythm. 

5:05: 15 minutes of affirmations + meditation.
I do it barefoot, standing in front of the mirror. I know it sounds strange, but saying things like “I am calm, I am focused.” actually sets my brain for the day. This is a game changer. Try out for a week and see. For meditations I go with guided meditation apps. Tried numerous, all are good. 

5:20: Hygiene.
Korean skincare combo (vitamin C, snail mucin, SPF 50). My skin started glowing and people at work noticed.

5:40: 0.3 L of lemon water, room temperature.
Don’t ask me about the science, but it wakes up my body better than coffee.

6:00: Gym: 4x a week, 1–1.5 hours.
Strength training + 10 min treadmill walk.
No headphones.  Part of my dopamine detox.

7:30: Shower, then a 15-minute foot massage with peppermint oil. Yes, seriously. It helps circulation, and triggers the lymphatic system. . 

7:50: Breakfast alone, 2 boiled eggs, 1 avocado, chia seeds soaked in lemon water.
I eat outside or in silence, never at the office. It’s my “quiet time.”
I usually read 5–10 pages of a book while eating (never fiction).

8:30: At work.
I put my phone in Focus mode and throw it in my bag. No notifications till 5PM.
This one habit alone probably doubled my output.


Since I started this, I feel sharper, calmer, more balanced. My boss literally said, “You seem like a completely different person.”

Some of the other microadjustments I made

	•	No social media. Period. Haven’t opened Instagram since February. Don’t miss them.

	•	No negative thoughts. If I catch myself thinking one, I literally snap my fingers and replace it with a positive one.

	•	Therapy, twice a week. Every week. I treat it like gym for the brain.

	•	Cold showers every morning. I don’t overthink after, it’s like hitting reset.

	•	No caffeine after 10AM. My sleep improved instantly.

	•	Evening routine: journaling, stretching, magnesium before bed.

	•	Speaking slower. Makes me seem calmer and more confident, apparently.

	•	Gratitude texts. Every night I text one person something I appreciate about them.

	•	No complaining. If I do, I owe my therapist €5.

	•	Sunlight before 8AM. Game changer.

	•	Chewing slower. Sounds dumb, but digestion improved and I stopped overeating.


I know it’s a lot. But every one of these micro changes added up.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that discipline isn’t about control - it’s about peace within. Come from a good place. Treat your body and mind like a temple and it will all come naturally.

Closing thought: I know many of you are going through a personal struggle I don’t see…so I’m sending you encouragement and positive vibes to make a change. You got this. If I could - so can you.

1. **u/Sensitive_Purchase71** (↑40): I'm sorry OP, I don't buy it. You mentioned you have kids in a comment. No mention of them in your morning routine (not even helping to get ready or cooking breakfast for them). Not that this approach...

## 4. What AI tools actually help us study things 10x faster

**📝 Full Post Content:**

> Some context: my mindset for using AI tools in studying is more about brainstorming, help me organize some messy thoughts and files, and expand my thoughts, turning them into something that meaningful. Less focus on getting essay drafts or help on exams

Based on that, here are some AI tools that I've found genuinely useful and curious about what tools you guys are using

**Perplexity AI:** my go-to alternative to Google when I want to learn a new topic quickly and comprehensively. I feel like it combines real-time information with LLM reasoning and summarization so good, perfect when you want both accuracy and depth.

**NotebookLM:** since i highly rely on you/tube videos to self-study, this tool just blew my mind the first time I used it. It summarizes long videos and help you extract key takeaways, and saves you from hours of watching content that might not be worth your time. If you also have a lot of watch later videos like I did but want to filter out only the truly valuable ones, this is the one.

**Kuse:** my new alternatives for NotebookLM (sry we had good days), at first I was also drawn by its ability to summarize You\\Tube videos into mind maps and reports, but it's actually way more powerful, it can handle all kinds of files and helps you build a very intuitive knowledge base.

**Notion:** it's hard not to try Notion with its great UI and so many fancy templates. It's great when you want to turn messy notes or scattered info into structured, aesthetic outputs. But I personally find the learning curve a bit steep, especially if you just want something fast and simple.

Drop the tools that you are using and found it could be a game changer!

**💭 Top Comments:**

1. **u/crazycattx** (↑53): AI tools are good at getting the end result of having notes rather accurate and neat. All good. Still need to check them.

## 5. I built a dynamic, customizable Notion formula calendar (inspired by a recent post)

**🔗 Link:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1obr27k/i_built_a_dynamic_customizable_notion_formula/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1obr27k/i_built_a_dynamic_customizable_notion_formula/)

**👤 Author:** u/ruuuff | **📅 Date:** 2025-10-20 | **⬆️ Score:** 194 | **💬 Comments:** 31

**📍 Subreddit:** r/Notion

**📝 Full Post Content:**

> I recently came across a post by **vbgosilva**, showing a calendar built entirely with formulas.

I’ve always found the idea really cool. I’d thought about building something like that before, but never got around to it.

So I decided to take the concept and build my own version, focused on practicality and easy customization so I can reuse it.

After a few hours of work, I ended up with the version shown in the first image of this post. I thought about commenting on his post, but didn’t want to come off as impolite. So I decided to make this a separate post, more detailed and, of course, giving full credit to the inspiration.

What I like most about the formula is that it’s completely generic. You can change the date, style, or date logic without having to rewrite everything.

**🧮 The formula**

    /* first lets block - sets up base calendar variables: dates, weekdays, and day styles */
    lets(
      baseDate, today(),
      weekdaysAbbrList, ["Su", "Mo", "Tu", "We", "Th", "Fr", "Sa"],
      todayStyle, ["default", "blue_background"],
      defaultDayStyle, ["gray", "gray_background"],
      inactiveDayStyle, ["gray", "default_background"],
      padSize, 2,
      nextMonthDate, baseDate.dateAdd(1, "month"),
      firstDayNextMonth, parseDate(nextMonthDate.formatDate("YYYY-MM-01")),
      baseDateLastDay, firstDayNextMonth.dateSubtract(1, "day"),
      emptyDaysList, " ".repeat(baseDateLastDay.date()).split(""),
      firstDayWeekday, parseDate(baseDate.formatDate("YYYY-MM-01")).day(),
      lastDayWeekday, baseDateLastDay.day(),
      firstGap, " ".repeat(if(firstDayWeekday == 7, 0, firstDayWeekday)).split(""),
      lastGap, " ".repeat(if(lastDayWeekday == 7, 6, 6 - lastDayWeekday)).split(""),
      weekdaysAbbrList.map(current.padStart(padSize, " ").style("c", defaultDayStyle)).join(" ") + "\n" +
      [
        firstGap.map((current.padStart(padSize, " ")).style("c", inactiveDayStyle)).join(" "),
        /* second lets block - maps over emptyDaysList to generate styled calendar days with separators */
        emptyDaysList.map(lets(
          dayNumber, index + 1,
          date, parseDate(baseDate.formatDate("YYYY-MM-" + dayNumber.format().padStart(2, "0"))),
          /* ifs block - conditional styles for day states */
          dayStyle, ifs(
            date == today(), todayStyle,
            date < today(), inactiveDayStyle,
            defaultDayStyle
          ),
          styledDay, dayNumber.format().padStart(padSize, " ").style("c", dayStyle),
          weekdayNumber, date.day(),
          separator, ifs(index == 0 or weekdayNumber != 7, "", "\n"),
          separator + styledDay
        )).join(" "),
        lastGap.map((current.padStart(padSize, " ")).style("c", inactiveDayStyle)).join(" ")
      ].filter(current).join(" ")
    )

Just copy and paste this formula, and you’ll have a beautiful calendar for the current month!

**⚙️ How to customize**

* `baseDate` — the date within the desired month/year for the calendar (or keep `today()` for the current month).
* `weekdaysAbbrList` — a list of abbreviated weekdays, starting with Sunday and ending with Saturday.
* `todayStyle`, `defaultDayStyle`, and `inactiveDayStyle` — define the color scheme for the days.
* `padSize` — controls the spacing within the day blocks (useful if you want to abbreviate weekdays to 3 characters).

It’s complete, but beyond just a nice-looking calendar, you’re probably looking for a way to display or track something with the dates.

**📅 Example with a Habit Tracker**

Assuming you have two databases:

1. **Habits** — containing the habits you want to track (where this formula will go).
2. **Tracked Habits** — where you record the days a habit was completed.

The **Tracked Habits** database needs two properties:

1. **Date** — to indicate the day the habit was completed.
2. **Two-way relation with Habits** — to link the record to the corresponding habit.

Now, back to the calendar formula (in the **Habits** database), add this variable to the first `lets` block, right after `baseDate`:

    trackedHabitsDateList, prop("Tracked Habits").filter(current.prop("Date").formatDate("YYYY-MM") == baseDate.formatDate("YYYY-MM")).map(current.prop("Date")),

• This code accesses the **relational property Tracked Habits**, filters only the pages matching the same month and year as the `baseDate` variable, and creates a list of dates.

Then, in the second `lets` block, right after the `date` variable, add:

    isDateInTrackedList, trackedHabitsDateList.includes(date),

• This checks whether the calendar `date` is in the `trackedHabitsDateList` and returns a true or false value.

Finally, you can modify the `ifs` block to apply conditional styles based on the marked days:

    dayStyle, ifs(
      isDateInTrackedList and date == today(), ["default", "Green_background"],
      isDateInTrackedList, ["Green", "Green_background"],
      date == today(), todayStyle,
      date < today(), inactiveDayStyle,
      defaultDayStyle
    ),

*Note: Return the styles as a list* \[\]*, e.g.,* \["default", "Green\_background"\]*.*

Done! You should now have a dynamic calendar based on your own records.

If you want to see a practical example of the instructions above: [Habit Tracker](https://ruuuff.notion.site/Habit-Tracker-28e47804890c80a8801eeda3ccaafbf3).

In this case, I used a Habit Tracker, but the logic can be adapted for any kind of date-based tracking. However, some prior knowledge of logic and Notion formulas may be necessary.

I thought about keeping this exclusive to my templates, but it was too cool not to share.

I hope you find it useful!

And once again, thanks to **vbgosilva** for the inspiration.

*Edit: I’m also a creator! If you’d like to explore templates made with the same care as this post and formula, you can find them here:* [ruff | Notion Marketplace](https://www.notion.com/@ruuuff)*. Thanks!!*

1. **u/PlanswerLab** (↑24): I think this post and previous post you mentioned should be pinned somewhere or kept in a Notion Tips, Tricks & Modules post or something because this setup is being regularly asked about.

2. **u/karlcaiu** (↑12): That is very impressive. Didn't know formulas could go that far

> I clocked in this morning full of motivation coffee brewed, playlist on, Notion tabs ready and somehow it’s 6 PM and I have nothing to show for it except Slack replies and brain fog. I think this is what “fake productivity” feels like. You look busy, your calendar’s full, you’re in constant motion but nothing meaningful gets done. It’s like your brain’s buffering all day.  
Out of frustration I wrote “DO ONE REAL THING” on a sticky note and forced myself to focus on a single task. Ended up finishing a small landing page redesign I’d been putting off for weeks.  
That tiny win hit like dopamine crack, it felt like a win on myprize. That little change worked way better than any productivity app. I think I’ve been chasing “organized chaos” when all I really needed was to simplify. Anyone else find that less structure actually works better than overplanning?

## 8. What's the ONE thing that makes you stop using a to-do app?

**📝 Full Post Content:**

> I'll be honest – I've tried **everything**. Todoist, Notion, Agilo, Any.do, Apple Reminders, Google Tasks, physical planners.

And here's the embarrassing part: I always start with so much energy. I organize everything beautifully, set up my perfect system, feel productive for about 2 weeks... and then it all falls apart. I end up back at square one with tasks scattered across 3 apps and 47 browser tabs.

**My personal struggle:**

* My task list gets overwhelming (100+ items) and I freeze
* I can't prioritize – everything feels urgent
* The dopamine hit from checking boxes isn't enough to keep me going
* I spend more time organizing tasks than actually doing them
* Weekly reviews feel like a chore, so I skip them... and then lose track of everything

I'm researching this because I refuse to believe I'm alone in this cycle. I want to understand what *actually* makes task management fail for people like us.

**So here's my question:**

**What's YOUR biggest frustration with to-do apps?**

Is it:

* Too many features (overwhelming)?
* Too few features (too basic)?
* Lack of motivation/accountability?
* Can't prioritize effectively?
* Gets cluttered too fast?
* Doesn't match how your brain works?
* Something else entirely?

And if you've found something that *actually works* for you long-term (6+ months), I'd love to know what made it stick.

*(Full transparency: I'm exploring building something better, but right now I'm just trying to understand the real problems. Not selling anything – genuinely just want to learn from your experiences.)*

Thanks for reading.

3. **u/Forward-Skirt-5710** (↑13): most to-do apps fail because they treat planning like progress. mine always crumble when I over-engineer them. what finally worked was a dumb text file + daily 3 priorities. less dopamine, more doing.

Anyway, I think we all know [about that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1odxw00/notion_will_ban_your_account_for_no_reason_and/), [and the truth he saw in it, not only was it against the TOS and illegal, but it was also something public, which could be seen by others and not just the owner of the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1odxw00/comment/nkycnrw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

And even so, I researched and researched, certifications such as SOC 2 Type 1 and SOC 2 Type 2, and comments saying that Notion cannot read your private notes, like this:

even with all that, the question in the title remains, will you still use and trust Notion?

(I would try to migrate it 100% to Obsidian, but Notion still does things that Obsidian doesn't do at the moment for me to migrate 100%, thus forcing me to use both)

Random software renewals, forgotten invoices, duplicate charges all these tiny things that add up and eat hours of my week. I’m not even in accounting, but because I handle operations and “care about details,” it somehow became my problem. We’ve got subscriptions spread across multiple cards, random freelance payments, and tools that nobody remembers signing up for. I’ve tried Notion tables, Google Sheets, even a few expense-tracking apps, but they all just end up creating more admin work instead of reducing it. I suggested switching to Ramp but my team isn’t open to it cuz they’re too focused on shortterm gains to even consider the benefits.

> Hey all 👋

I've recently gone down the Notion rabbit hole and I'm basically migrating my entire life into it at this point. Finances, property stuff, pet records, insurance docs, tech infrastructure notes. I think I'm subconciously heading towards a second brain / Life RAG kind of setup that'll work well with AI tools going forward.

I've been going hard on the database first approach instead of just making a bunch of random pages. Once you start using relations and rollups and filtered views, its honestly kind of addictive seeing everything connect together.

I'm also using Notion AI a fair bit (its pretty good), but I've caught it deleting or overwriting stuff a few times without asking, which is... fun. So yeah, keeping an eye on that.

Anyway, for people who've been using Notion for a while, what do you wish you'd done differently from the start? What should I be thinking about now before this thing gets too big and complex?

Any wisdom appreciated

I foresaw this enshitification when I first knew that Notion is just a web app. I don't know why the heck do companies still insist on making large pieces of software using JavaScript. I just saw AppFlowy and it uses C++ and Rust. The Notion devs should probably  learn from them and start migrating to a real programming language. Else, the app will become an unusable pile of shit.

Edit: It turns out that the major problem is with the mobile app (Android at least). I've been using it as my main during that time that I noticed the extreme slowness. The desktop app is kinda ok, but certainly not optimal. The mobile app is a piece of shit and completely unusable, however.

> I’ve noticed something pretty weird (and honestly unsettling) with the **Notion desktop app**.

Every time I join a Zoom, Meet, or Teams call, Notion instantly pops up the banner:

👉 *“Meeting detected - Start AI Meeting Notes.”*

That would make sense *if* Notion had access to my microphone or calendar... but it doesn’t. I’ve completely revoked **microphone and screen recording permissions** at the system level, and the app still somehow *knows* when a meeting starts. So… how is it detecting that?

The only logical explanation is that the desktop client is **scanning active processes or window titles** in the background, basically watching what apps are running (like “zoom.us”, “Google Meet”, etc.). That’s not just a minor UX trick: it’s a form of **process monitoring**. Even if it’s not recording audio, it’s still behavior most people would *never expect* from a note-taking app.

Has anyone found a way to completely stop this detection? Or has Notion ever commented on it publicly? I really think this deserves more visibility; it’s about transparency, not paranoia.

> i’ve been using notion for a year and a half now as a second brain, and i truly love it. it really works well with how i like to organize things, and it’s easy to not get too bogged down in customization (at least for me). specifically, i write a lot. i have multiple projects going on at any given time, ranging from ~5k words to >60k. one of the reasons i love notion is the ability to write on both my laptop and phone whenever i want. i’ve always had lag problems with the app one my iphone, but today i opened the app and it could not load my latest ~20k wip. it just kept loading, stuttering, and starting over in an endless loop. i really don’t want to move away from this program, but so much of what i use it for is writing, and i’m concerned it’s going to remain this bad or even deteriorate. is anyone else having this problem, does anyone have a fix, or does anyone have recommendations on how to keep it from lagging/endlessly cycling?

Has anyone with Notion Enterprise been hit with about a 40% licence increase in cost (100 users) as AI is now bundled by default?

We have been told AI cannot be opted out of, even though our org cannot enable it due to data governance policies. Not to mention feedback from our test users has been underwhelming at best, the AI component doesn’t justify the cost hike.

> I saw the uproar over [this post here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/1odxw00/notion_will_ban_your_account_for_no_reason_and/)

I don't normally pay attention when people get banned on cloud software due to the fact that more often than not, they are doing something that clearly violates TOS to receive a ban. However, with my recent move from Clickup to Notion, and the fact I am running multiple company projects & tasks within it, I decided to dig into Notion's [Content & Use Policy.](https://www.notion.so/notion/Content-Use-Policy-1b9a773d5583486cb5c1d39a8d777a55) 

Some things that concern me and are a bit ambiguous *(I'm not an attorney)* are the following:

**1. You may not use Notion to post, upload, share, or store malicious software, malware, viruses, or other harmful code.**

**Why this matters:**

* The wording around “malicious software” and “other harmful code” feels too broad.
* JSON files are just plain text, but some systems might treat them as “code” if they include logic, API references, or scripts.
* I want to confirm that storing AI agent setups, configs, or templates as simple JSON files is fine under this policy.
* On the flip side, I understand that encoded automation scripts or runnable code could cross the line. I just want clarity that plain text configs like .doc or .txt are safe and compliant. 

**2. You may not use Notion to post or share content that is illegal or infringes on the rights of others (including intellectual-property rights)**

**Why this matters:**

* We sometimes store videos or images made in tools like Sora, Veo, or Runway that include brand logos or celebrity likenesses, but only with written client approval. Does that still fall under “posting or sharing content that infringes on the rights of others”?
* If an automation pulls that approved content from Notion and posts it to a client’s site or social media, how does Notion decide if that’s a violation?
* Is enforcement based on automated flags, third-party reports, or verified proof of rights?
* Also, does simply storing approved visuals of medical products or other brand assets inside Notion count as “posting or sharing”?
* We use Adobe, Canva, Veo, etc for design and creation. Notion is just for reference, task tracking, and delivery. 
* Some of our automations publish those approved assets externally with full client permission, and I’d like to confirm if that counts as “posting or sharing” under Notion’s policy.



Are there any Notion Folks on here that could help out with this? I want to make sure we stay in compliance.

I got a student discount when I created my notion. Now my student ID is no longer active. When I try to export everything to "Markdown and CSV" - it tells me "We will email you with the download link". But I don't have access to the email anymore.

What can be done now?  
Can someone who has done something similar help me?

**📝 Full Post Content:**

> As a liberal arts student, I've tons of files and sources that have track and store for, and tried a lot of note-taking tools or knowledge management system. In my freshman year, I relied entirely on pen and paper, by sophomore year, I fell in love with OneNote. In junior year, Notion became my main tool. By senior year, I gradually phased out both OneNote and Notion, switching to a combination of Zotero (for research) and Kuse (for all other coursework and career prep).

I've truly experienced how different (or seems fancy) these tools, and honestly they all have pros and const, it's just important to pick the one or system that fits your own demand or main goal. So hope some of my takeaways can help you choose what works best for you.

OneNote: what I love most about OneNote is its layout flexibility, it's easy to organize and visually extend your pages. The UI fits my aesthetic perfectly, and it feels almost like a digital bullet journal, I can layer notes infinitely and rearrange them in a very intuitive way which I really like.
Its biggest downside for me is weak synchronization. Since I often record the information in a lot of different formats and across devices, syncing and integrating notes became inconvenient over time.

Notion: it offers the widest variety of templates for sure, from notes to dashboards, calendars, and entire workspaces. Also I like that it supports Markdown, and its overall clean design is something I really appreciate.
But after long-term use, I found myself valuing form over function. It started feeling a bit too fancy for simple note-taking. For quick daily captures or lightweight learning notes, the structures sometimes felt unnecessarily complex for me, and it did affect some of my positivity

Kuse: one thing I like most is that it supports all file types, PDFs, videos, images, links, into one visual workspace.
It gives me the freedom and spatial flexibility I once loved in OneNote, but with stronger capabilities for deep learning, resource integration, and creative output. I also love that it can easily generate portfolios or websites directly from your workspace. The downside so far is that there aren't many advanced templates or mature use cases available yet. Customizing the visual style or building a personal workflow aesthetic still takes a lot of effort.

Obsidian: a classic Markdown-based editor, love the customization and flexibility. Also the plugin ecosystem is incredibly rich, and I especially love the built-in mind map support. But that's also part of the challenge: with so many plugins, community scripts, and tutorials, the learning curve can be steep. It's powerful but it also takes serious time and experimentation to build a personal system that feels cohesive and efficient like other fancy tutorials look like.

> I’ve been using Notion for everything lately such as projects, docs, content calendars, meeting notes, and I’ve hit that point where it starts feeling like an unsearchable archive. Once I pass 10+ projects, I forget where I’ve tucked certain pages or which database I linked something to.

I started experimenting with a few tools to help with recall instead of just structure. Notion is still my main hub, but I’ve been pairing it with eesel AI, which automatically surfaces the pages and docs for me that I’ve opened recently across Notion, Google Docs, and even Figma. 

It doesn’t change how I build databases or dashboards, but it helps me find what I built faster. Curious if anyone else here combines Notion with external tools to handle recall and context switching. Do you rely purely on naming conventions and backlinks, or use automation to help?

I started storing documents and personal reflections in Notion past month and I plan to use it for long term like 5 years or so. Is it safe for this use or should I switch to some other platform like Obsedian or any else recommendation for same. Thanks a lot.

## 48. The only productivity app that actually stuck for me (after trying like 30)

> I’ve gone through every productivity app you can name — Notion, Todoist, ClickUp, Trello, Sunsama, Motion… all of them.
Every time I’d spend hours setting it up, only to abandon it a week later.

The one that finally clicked? Google Calendar + simple sticky notes.
Nothing fancy — just color-coded time blocks and one sticky note on my desk with my top 3 tasks.

It’s crazy how going simpler made me more consistent.
No dashboards, no setup time, no endless tweaking — just doing the work.

Sometimes the best productivity “tool” isn’t smarter software. It’s removing the friction that makes you avoid opening it.

Curious — what’s the ONE app or setup you’ve actually stuck with long-term?


**💭 Top Comments:**

1. **u/ingo_notetakingguy** (↑8): From my experience it’s never about the tool itself. Key is to find the mindest, “process” and habit that fits to you personally.

For me the turnaround was a little variation of the GTD principle tha...

2. **u/iwantboringtimes** (↑6): I (still) have a lot of sticky notes, but I had to give up on using them mostly because lost sticky notes are very very annoying.

Heck, for a time, I attached tiny binder clips to the sticky notes, s...

> There seems to be a lot of panic and outrage over lost data. This is consistent across most SaaS platforms. At my workplace we are facing issues with Microsoft, Trello, Adobe, Acquia DAM and PIM, WFX and Netsuite, Rippling, and many other cloud-based tools. 

Pretty much every site or app you use runs some part of their service through AWS servers. 

Y'all need to RELAX. Back up your data. Ride out the storm. Go local or analog for a few days. 

You'll be fine. 





**💭 Top Comments:**

1. **u/BackupLABS** (↑7): You’d be surprised at how many people think that because their data “is in the cloud” that they don’t need to back it up. 

From our research I’d say it’s 95% of consumers and 60% of IT people. Which ...
